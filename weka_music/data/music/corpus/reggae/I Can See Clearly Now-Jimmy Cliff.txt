I can see clearly now the rain is gone

 

I can see all obstacles in my way

 

Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind

Its gonna be a bright (bright)

Bright (bright) sunshiny day

Its gonna be a bright (bright)

Bright (bright) sunshiny day

 

Ooh, yes, I can make it now the pain is gone

 

All of the bad feelings have disappeared

 

Here is that rainbow Ive been praying for

Its gonna be a bright (bright)

Bright (bright) sunshiny day

 

(Ooh) look all around, theres nothing but blue skies

 

Look straight ahead, theres nothing but blue skies

 

I can see clearly now the rain is gone

 

I can see all obstacles in my way

 

Here is that rainbow Ive been praying for

Its gonna be a bright (bright)

Bright (bright) sunshiny day

Its gonna be a bright (bright)

Bright (bright) sunshiny day

Its gonna be a bright (bright)

Bright (bright) sunshiny day

Its gonna be a bright (bright)

Bright (bright) sunshiny day, yeah

Its gonna be a bright (bright)

Bright (bright) sunshiny day

 

Bright (bright) bright, bright sunshiny day
