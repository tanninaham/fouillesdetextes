"You Can Get It If You Really Want"
(originally by Desmond Dekker)

You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try
Youll succeed at last

Persecution you must fear
Win or lose you got to get your share
Youve got your mind set on a dream
You can get it though hard it may seem now

You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try
Youll succeed at last

I know it   listen

Rome was not built in a day
Opposition will come your way
But the hotter the battle you see
Is the sweeter the victory now

You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try
Youll succeed at last
