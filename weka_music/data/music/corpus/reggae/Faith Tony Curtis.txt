Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
knowing not everybody
Has a body like you
But Ive got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh but I
Need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
And when that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But Im showing you the door
Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have, I gotta have faith
Baby, I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have, I gotta have faith
Said I gotta have faith, faith, faith

Baby
I know youre asking me to stay
Say please, please, please, dont go away
You say Im giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Cant help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But Ill wait for something more

Yes Ive gotta have faith...
