Out in the street, they call it merther

Welcome to Jamrock
Camp where the thugs dem camp at
Two pound ah weed inna van back
It inna your hand bag, your knapsack
It inna your backpack
The smell ah give your girlfriend contact
Some boy nuh know dis
Dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And dont know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals ah nuh back to
The thugs dem will do whe dem got to
And wont think twice to shot you
Dont make dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bare tuff ting come at you
When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block off traffic
Then dem wheel and pop off and dem start clap it
With the pin file down an it ah beat rapid
Police coming inna jeep and dem cant stop it
Some say them ah playboy, ah playboy rabbit
Funny man ah get dropped like a bad habit
So nuh bodah pose tuff if you dont have it
Rastafari stands alone

Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the streets, they call it merther

Welcome to Jam down
Where poor people ah dead at random
Political violence, cant done
Pure ghost and phantom
The youth dem get blind by stardom
Now the kings of kings ah call
Old man to pickney, so wave unuh hand if you with me
To see this sufferation sick me
Dem suit no fit me,
To win election dem trick we
Then dem dont do nuttin at all
Cmon lets face it, a ghetto educations basic
And most ah de youths them waste it
And when dem waste it
Thats when dem take the guns replace it
Then dem dont stand a chance at all
And thats why ah nuff little youth have up some fat matic
With the extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And ah bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who nah lock Glocks, ah dem a lock rocket
They will full you up ah current like ah short circuit
Dem a run ah road back which part the cops block it
And from now till a mornin nuh stop clock it
If dem run outta rounds ah bruck back ratchet
