Old pirates, yes they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
But minutes after they took I
To the bottomless pit
But my hand were made strong
By the hands of the almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly
So wont you help me sing
These songs of freedom
Is all I ever had
Redemption song
Emancipate yourself from the mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Don t be afraid of atomic energy
Cause none of them cannot test the time
So how long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand around and look
They say its just a part of it
Weve got to fulfill the book
So wont you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Is all that I ever had
Redemption song, redemption song
Redemption
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Emancipate yourselves from the mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Dont be afraid of atomic energy
Cause none a them cannot test the time
So how long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand around and look
They say its just a part of it
Weve got to fulfill the book
So wont you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Is all that I ever had redemption song
Redemption song
Redemption song
