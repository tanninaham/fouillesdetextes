Stone love with the number one sound

A 44 in the background

No platinum selector of the time

Dont watch my size in this hall

While my backs against the wall

Take a ride, competition take a ride

Pull it operator try the other side

Thought it was over, so far from done

As they dance into the sun

Some bring up new style holding trophy cups

Rory select while my speakers erupt

The sounds sweeter with an echo chamber

Dont you know that they are the danger

Three bottles of Cristal and its agreed

The best would only come from the Don Wesley

Close my eyes while I take a ride

Fold the bag in a yard style, oh

Dont worry bout that, you see its all natural

Police chasing this bandilero

Running down the road with my thick payroll

One stop was my music shop

Where I heard this guitar screamin

â™ª

Some bring up new style holding trophy cups

Rory select while my speakers erupt

The sounds sweeter with an echo chamber

Dont you know that they are the danger

Three bottles of Cristal and its agreed

The best would only come from the Don Wesley

Close my eyes and take a ride

Take a ride, everybody take a ride

Take a ride, everybody take a ride

Take a ride, everybody take a ride

Take a ride everybody take a ride (stone love with the number one sound)

Take a ride everybody take a ride (stone love with the number one sound)

Take a ride everybody take a ride (stone love with the number one sound)

Take a ride everybody take a ride (stone love with the number one sound)

Take a ride everybody take a ride (stone love, stone love, stone)

Take a ride everybody take a ride (stone love, stone love, stone)

Take a ride everybody take a ride (stone love, stone love, stone)

Take a ride everybody take a ride (stone love, stone love, stone)
