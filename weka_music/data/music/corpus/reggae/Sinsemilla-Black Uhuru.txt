Ah where, Ill phone ya
And how de international farmer
Ive got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Ive got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Dont cut down the cali tree
Cause it makes the best tea for me
Ive seen doctor say, it gives naturally
One thing this doctor will need
A lot of food
To survive and go through, in Babylon
Ive got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Ive got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Yes, Ive walked the streets and seen children downtown
Begging everyone they see, and it hurt me
It cant be right for what this world do for the youth
And the little herb Im selling, they want to capture me
I and I dont cherish wickedness
Because its none profit to I and I
Ive got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard, oh
Ive the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Anything that is none profit
I and I dont take for it
Pass it, pass it
All over I and I
No need to fraid
Looks like a mansion, ah
Life well different
Four little birds
Ive got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Ive the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
There is a red house over yonder
Full of marijuana
Ive been sitting on the corner
Chatting up with the farmer, oh
Got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Ive the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Free the herb, free the herb
Heal the nation
Heal the sick
Sell, sell that herb
To be rich
I think what we would want in life
Theres some of what is going on
That we dont want a thing in life
To be goin round like worm, no, no
Id rather do sin-
Stalk of Sinsemilla
Ive got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Ive the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
He dreamt thats what theyd mention
For marijuana
