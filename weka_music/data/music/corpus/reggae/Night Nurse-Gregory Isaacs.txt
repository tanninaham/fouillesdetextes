Tell her try your best, just to make it quick

Woman tend to the sick

 

Cause there must be something she can do

This heart, is broken in two

 

Tell her its a case of emergency

Theres a patient, by the name of Gregory

Night nurse

Only you alone can quench this here thirst

My night nurse (oh, gosh)

Oh, the pain is getting worse

I dont wanna see no Doc

I need attendance from my nurse around the clock

 

Cause theres no prescription for me

Shes the one, the only remedy

Night nurse

Only you alone, can quench this here thirst

My night nurse

Oh, the pain is getting worse

Im hurt by love

 

I dont wanna see no Doc

 

I need attendance from my nurse around the clock

 

For theres no prescription for me

Shes the one, the only remedy

Night nurse

Only you alone can quench this here thirst

My night nurse

Oh, the pain is getting worse

Im hurt, my love

 

And Im sure

No doctor can cure

 

Night nurse

 

Night nurse

Oh, gosh
