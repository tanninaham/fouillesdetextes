Hows it going dude?

Hey man, whats up?

Tell Todd he can turn the radio back on

When you grab a hold of me

You tell me that Ill never be set free

But Im a parasite

Creep and crawl, I step into the night

Two pints of booze

Tell me, are you a badfish too?

(Are you a badfish too?)

Aint got no money to spend

I hope the night would never end

Lord knows Im weak

Wont somebody get me off of this reef?

Baby youre a big blue whale

Grab the reef when all duck divin fails

I swim, but I wish Id never learned

The waters too polluted with germs

I dive deep when its ten feet overhead

Grab the reef underneath my bed

(Underneath my bed)

Aint got no quarrels with God

Aint got no time to grow old

Lord knows Im weak

Wont somebody get me off of this reef?

 

I gotta go dude

 

Aint got no quarrels with God

Aint got no time to get old

Lord knows Im weak

Wont somebody get me off of this reef?
