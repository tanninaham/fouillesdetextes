Life has come a long way since yesterday, I say

And its not the same old thing over again, I say

Just do what you feel and dont you fool yourself, I say

Cause I cant make you happy unless I am, I say, I say I

Got to be true to myself

Got to be true to myself

Got to be true to myself

Got to be true to myself

Day in day out, Ive asked many questions, I say

Only to find the truth it never changes, I say

If you dont deal with it it keeps killing you a little by little, I say

 

Call me selfish if you will my life I alone can live, I say, I say I

Got to be true to myself

Got to be true to myself, anyway now

Got to be true to myself

Got to be true to myself

 

I dont care if it hurts

Im tired of lies and all these games

Ive reached a point in life

Eh, no longer can I be this way, dont come crying to me

I too have shed my share of tears

Im moving on, yes Im grooving on, well Im finally free Ive

Got to be true to myself

Got to be true to myself, anyway yall

Got to be true to myself

Got to be true to myself

Come on now, got to be true

Got to be true, got to be true to myself

Anyway yall, got to be true

Got to be true, got to be true to myself
