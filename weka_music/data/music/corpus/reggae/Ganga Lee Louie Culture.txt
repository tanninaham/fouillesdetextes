No man can decide my destiny!
Only I can decide my own for me!
Why?
Cause Im an ol Ganga Lee
How it go?

I wanna be free from all chains, and all bangles and ropes
Free from all bars, and all borders and doors
Free to praise the Lord, because me nah praise di Pope
So why now you a wash your face with Babylon soap?
Me have whole heap of faith, that mean me have whole heap of hope
Life rough and hard, but with it me haffi cope
Some take it pon di level and some slide down the slope
Silent river run deep, but Ganga Lee have to float

I was born to be free..
And me a ol Ganga Lee, Ganga Lee
Man a ol Ganga Lee, Ganga Lee
Man a ol Gangsta Lee, Gangsta Lee
And who have eyes, they will see

Say!
Me no come yaso fi joke and me no come yaso fi laugh
Me deh yah pon a mission and me complete half
Jah is my rod, of course He is my staff
If you love the cow, you haffi accept the calf
Coulda beat me little more, me get hard instead of soft
Iniquity workers all a work witchcraft
Dem inject mi body with coal, but me no cough
Serious like a all fifty judge weh nah laugh

I was born to be free..
And me a ol Ganga Lee, Ganga Lee
Man a ol Ganga Lee, Ganga Lee
Man a ol Ganga Lee, Ganga Lee
And who have eyes, they will see

Me beg dem fi let me go now and make me fly like a bird
Jah send me out, so mi voice must be heard
I am the sheep, and a Him a the shepherd
Try stop mi something, nah go happen, please mark mi words

I was born to be free..
And me a ol Ganga Lee, Ganga Lee
Man a ol Ganga Lee, Ganga Lee
Man a ol Ganga Lee, Ganga Lee
And who have eyes, they will see

Say!
Original ganga lee put up fi your hand, make me see it
Southside, Spoilers, and down a Tel Aviv
Tivoli Gardens and di Spanglers posse
What teacher learn, fi the Infinity
From you born to be free, you a ol ganga..

Ol Ganga Lee, Ganga Lee
Man a ol Ganga Lee, Ganga Lee
Man a ol Gangsta Lee, Gangsta Lee
And who have eyes, they will see

Say!
I wanna be free from all chains, and all bangles and ropes
Free from all bars, and all borders and doors
Free to praise the Lord, because me nah praise di Pope
