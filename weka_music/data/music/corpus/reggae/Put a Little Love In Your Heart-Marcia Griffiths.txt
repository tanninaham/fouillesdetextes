Feel the cold wind blowing winters coming on

Tis the season, so they say

If you need help believing cause your spirit aint too strong

Hold my hand, well push that cloud away

And put a little holiday in your heart

Itll put a little shuffle in your step

Give you a song that you can sing

With a melody you cant forget

And if you wanna join in a little harmony

To keep the world from tearin apart

Well, you know where to look

Yeah, you gotta put a little holiday in your heart

Theres a man on the corner who doesnt have a name

People pass and turn their heads away

But to share a simple kindness would set there heart aflame

And youll get more than youll ever give away

So, put a little holiday in your heart

Itll put a little shuffle in your step

Give you a song that you can sing

With a melody you cant forget

And if you wanna join in a little harmony

To keep the world from tearin apart

Well, you know where to look

Yeah, you gotta put a little holiday in your heart

It starts with you, it starts with me

That aint no stranger, hes family

And it dont matter if we agree

It all comes down to love

So, put a little holiday in your heart

Itll put a little shuffle in your step

Give you a song that you can sing

With a melody you cant forget

And if you wanna join in a little harmony

To keep the world from tearin apart

Well, you know where to look

Yeah, you gotta put a little holiday in your heart

So, put a little holiday in your heart

Itll put a little shuffle in your step

Give you a song that you can sing

With a melody you cant forget

And if you wanna join in a little harmony

To keep the world from tearin apart

Well, you know where to look

Yeah, you gotta put a little holiday in your heart

Well, you know where to look

Yeah, you gotta put a little holiday in your heart
