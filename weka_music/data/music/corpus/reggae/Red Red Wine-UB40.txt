Red, red wine

Go to my head

Make me forget that I

Still need her so

Red, red wine

Its up to you

All I can do, Ive done

Memries wont go

Memries wont go

 

Id have sworn

That with time

Thoughts of you would leave my head

I was wrong

Now I find

Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine

Stay close to me

Dont let me be alone

Its tearin apart

My blue, blue heart

 

Id have sworn

That with time

Thoughts of you would leave my head

I was wrong

Now I find

Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine

Stay close to me

Dont let me be alone

Its tearin apart

My blue, blue heart

 

Red, red wine

Stay close to me

Dont let me be alone

Its tearin apart

My blue, blue heart
