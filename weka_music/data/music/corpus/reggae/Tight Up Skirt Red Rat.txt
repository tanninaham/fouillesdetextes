Unuh a mad we in your latest Moschino dress, tight up on your chest
Have your body a grab we
In your mini skirt and Versace shirt, man brains a hurt
And girlfriend, trust me!
Anytime you pass in your C.K. glass
You a mash up mirage
Every Tuesday night
Nuff man all a fight
Cyan sleep at night
And me feel you a do it for spite

Hey!
Everywhere you go, man surround you, cho! (surround you!)
Inna bere lyrics, dem drown you (drown you!)
Like the queen of England, them crown you (crown you!)
And when you walk pon the road, a pure car man sound you
"Jesum!"
"Gyal you hot, eeh!"
Ohhh nooo
Gyal youre sweet
Cho!
