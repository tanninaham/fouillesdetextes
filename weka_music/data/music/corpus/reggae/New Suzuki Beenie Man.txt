Hey
Hey, hey

Cool man
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo! You a hear me?

The other night me buck a gyal inna mi new Suzuki
She never expect nothing big and spooky
Now the gyal cant look inna mi face
Gyal know say she lose the race
Gyal come, *Brap!*, inna mi new Suzuki
She never expect nothing big and spooky
Now the gyal cant look inna mi face
Gyal know say she lose the race
Hold on

Me know fi dugudugu, so that anuh self praise
Me tell the gyal say, "Gyal, no put your tongue inna mi ears"
You see how you make mi sumn raise, and me weak inna mi knees?
Now me dont even business if you waan have AIDS
Look how me tell the gyal she no fi play inna mi hair
She gwan, and gwan, and gwan until mi brief front tear
And me is a boy no really care if mi baby mother hear say me and a gyal a play "Bare As You Dare"
You see how me tell the gyal she no fi bet me fi do it
Me no like when me a talk and gyal a kiss dem teeth
A get, she get me inna heat
Now me and her haffi meet
Two dozen fence me see she take, down the street

Gyal run out at mi new Suzuki
She never expect nothing big and spooky
Now the gyal cant look inna mi face
Gyal know say she lose the race
Gyal come, *Brap!*, inna mi new Suzuki
She never expect nothing big and spooky
Now the gyal cant look inna mi face
Gyal know say she lose the race
Hold on

Tanya did a talk say, a she own the man

Marie a bounce bout pon the Pepperseed jam
Me waan know a weh dem get dem big talk deh from
So...me go check Marie
Link Petagay and Taniashe
Say, me want the whole of dem fi par with me
Make we have an ORGY
But anytime me go huff and me go puff like the three little pigs
She never know me coulda make she spin like a gig
She turn true it burn when the earthworm a dig
She never imagine say snake grow so big
Well!
So she start to plea
Lef G Minor and gone a C
Hear her nuh...
"Oh God, oh God
Oh God, oh God
Oh God, oh God
Oh God!

True me buck her up inna mi new Suzuki
She never expect nothing big and spooky
Now the gyal cant look inna mi face
Gyal know say she lose the race
Gyal come, *Brap!*, inna mi new Suzuki
She never expect nothing big and spooky
Now the gyal cant look inna mi face
Gyal know say she lose the race
Hold on

Me know fi dugudugu, so that anuh self praise
Me tell the gyal say, "Gyal, no put your tongue inna mi ears"
Now you make mi sumn raise, and me weak inna mi knees
Now me dont even business if you waan have AIDS
So, me tell the gyal she no fi play inna mi hair
Gwan, and gwan, and gwan until mi brief front tear
And me is a boy no really care if mi baby mother hear say me and a gyal a play "Bare As You Dare"
