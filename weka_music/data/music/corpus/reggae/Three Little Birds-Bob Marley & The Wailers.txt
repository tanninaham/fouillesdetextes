Dont worry, about a thing

Cause every little thing, gonna be all right

Singin, dont worry, about a thing

Cause every little thing, gonna be all right

Rise up this mornin

Smile with the risin sun

Three little birds

Pitched by my doorstep

Singin sweet songs

Of melodies pure and true

Sayin, "This is my message to you, whoo hoo"

Singin, dont worry, about a thing

Cause every little thing, is gonna be all right

Singin, dont worry, dont worry bout a thing

Cause every little thing, gonna be all right

Rise up this mornin

Smile with the risin sun

Three little birds

Pitched by my doorstep

Singin sweet songs

Of melodies pure and true

Sayin, "This is my message to you, whoo hoo"

Singin, dont worry, about a thing

Worry about a thing, no

Every little thing, gonna be all right

Dont worry

Singin, dont worry, about a thing

I wont worry!

Cause every little thing, gonna be alright

Hmm, dont worry, about a thing

Cause a every little thing, gonna be all right

I wont worry

Baby dont worry, about a thing

Cause every little thing, is gonna be all right

Say, dont worry about a thing, no girl

Cause every little thing gonna be all right
