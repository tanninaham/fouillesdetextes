Could you be loved then be loved?

Could you be loved then be loved?

Dont let them fool ya

 

Or even try to school ya, oh no

Weve got a mind of our own

So go to hell if what you thinkin is not right

Love would never leave us alone

Ah in the darkness, there must come out to light

Could you be loved then be loved?

Now could you be loved, woah yeah, then be loved?

 

(The road of life is rocky)

(And you may stumble too)

(So why dont you point your fingers)

(At someone else thats judging you)

Love your brother, man! (Could you be, could you be loved?)

(Could you be, could you be loved?)

(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)

(Could you be, could you be loved?)

Dont let them change ya, oh

 

Or even rearrange ya

Oh no

Weve got the life to live

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

They say only, only

Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive

Stay alive, eh

Could you be loved then be loved?

Now could you be loved, woah yeah, and be loved?

(Aint gon miss your water until your well runs dry) Oh yeah

Girl (No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied)
