Well, Ive been thinking lately much of my baby

Thinking how she needs me, yeah

And I dont see you know if shes feeling so bad

Feeling so bad, feeling so bad

Maybe its better

If I forget her

Let her go on

How I long to hold her tenderly (Tenderly)

How I long to hold her close to me (Close to me)

Maybe someday she will change her mind (Change her mind)

And let me taste her lips of wine

Lips of wine, woah, woah

Lips of wine in the morning

Lips of wine, woah, woah

Lips of wine in the evening

Lips of wine, woah, woah

Lips of wine in the morning

Lips of wine, woah, woah

Lips of wine

Maybe its better

Lips of wine, woah, woah

Lips of wine in the morning

Lips of wine, woah, woah

Lips of wine in the evening

Lips of wine, woah, woah

Lips of wine in the morning

Lips of wine, woah, woah

Lips of wine
