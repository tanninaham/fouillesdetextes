Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ive been trying a long, long time still I didnt make it
Everything I try to do seem to go wrong
It seems I have done something wrong
But theyre trying to keep me down
Who God bless, no one curse
Thank God Im not the worst
Better must come one day
Better must come, they cant conquer me
Better must come, yeah
Ive been trying a long, long time
But I cant make it
No one to give me a helping hand
They only tryin to keep me down
Who God bless, no one curse
Thank God Im not the worst
Oh, my people get a seat
Theyre trying to take advantage of me
Better must come, better must come, yeah
Better must come one day
Better must come, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ive been trying a long, long time still I cant make it
Everything I try to do seem to go wrong
It seems I have done something wrong
But theyre trying to keep me down
Who God bless, no one curse
Thank God Im not the worst
Better must come one day
Better must come, they cant conquer me
Better must come one day, better must come
Oh, better must come one day, better must come
Better must come one day, better must come
