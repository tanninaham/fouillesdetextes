I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track
It turns into gold
Everybody knows
Ive got the magic in me
When I hit the flow the girls come
Snappin at me
Now everybody wants some presto
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me
These tricks that Ill attempt
Will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse
Ill hypnotize you with every line
Ill need a volunteer
How about you, with the eyes?
Come on down to the front
And stand right here and dont be shy
Ill have you time travellin
Have your mind babblin
People tryin to inherit the skill
So they askin me
Even David Blaine had to go
And take some classes
And I see Mindfreak like
Whats up man, whats happenin?
So come one, come all
And see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded
No Ghost or Poltergeist
You know Im no Pinocchio
Ive never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man
I float on Cloud Nine
I got the magic in me
(I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it
Turns into gold
(Yes it turns to gold)
Everybody knows
Ive got the magic in me
(I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the flow the girls come
Snappin at me
(They be snappin baby)
Now everybody wants some presto
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me
Well, take a journey into my mind
Youll see why its venom I rhyme
Stay on the road
So I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane
Then jump into that crowd
See, see, when I rhyme
I flow on the beat like pidda dow dow
See I deceive you with my
Intergalactic ether
I sing just like Aretha
So respect me like Im Caesar
I kick it like Adidas
Flowin sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, cause what I be on
Will leave you with amnesia
I break all the rules
Like Evel Knievel
Its a spectacular show
Cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you saying
It dont entertain my ego
I do this everyday
Hocus pocus is my styl o
I got the magic in me
(I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it
Turns into gold
(Yes it turns to gold)
Everybody knows
Ive got the magic in me
(I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the flow the girls come
Snappin at me
(They be snappin baby)
Now everybody wants some presto
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me
