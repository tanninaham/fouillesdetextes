We were good, we were gold

Kinda dream that cant be sold

We were right til we werent

Built a home and watched it burn

Mmm, I didnt wanna leave you, I didnt wanna lie

Started to cry, but then remembered, I

I can buy myself flowers

Write my name in the sand

Talk to myself for hours

Say things you dont understand

I can take myself dancing

And I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than you can

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Paint my nails cherry red

Match the roses that you left

No remorse, no regret

I forgive every word you said

Ooh, I didnt wanna leave you, baby, I didnt wanna fight

Started to cry, but then remembered, I

I can buy myself flowers

Write my name in the sand

Talk to myself for hours, yeah

Say things you dont understand

I can take myself dancing, yeah

I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than you can

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I (ooh, I)

I didnt wanna leave you, I didnt wanna fight

Started to cry, but then remembered, I

Write my name in the sand

Talk to myself for hours (yeah)

Say things you dont understand (you never will)

I can take myself dancing, yeah

I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than

Yeah, I can love me better than you can

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby (uh)

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby (than you can)
