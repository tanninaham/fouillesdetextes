Baby, youve been so distant from me lately
And lately dont even wanna call you "baby"

Saw us getting older
Burning toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high
Waiting up for you upstairs
Why you act like Im not there?
Baby, right now it feels like

It feels like you dont care
Oh, why dont you recognize Im so rare?
Always there
You dont do the same for me
Thats not fair

I dont have it all
Im not claiming to
But I know that Im special, yeah
And Ill bet theres somebody else out there
To tell me Im rare, to make me feel rare

Baby, dont make me count up all the reasons
To stay with you
No reason why you and I are not succeeding
Uh uh
