Ooh, ooh, ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did

I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery

I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard

Ive learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you

I never stray too far from the sidewalk

Because of you

I learned to play on the safe side, so I dont get hurt

Because of you

I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me

Because of you, I am afraid

I lose my way

And its not too long before you point it out

I cannot cry

Because I know thats weakness in your eyes

Im forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life

My heart cant possibly break

When it wasnt even whole to start with

Because of you

I never stray too far from the sidewalk

Because of you

I learned to play on the safe side, so I dont get hurt

Because of you

I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me

Because of you

I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep (I watched you die, in your sleep)

I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me (I was too young for you to lean on me)

You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain (You never saw me)

And now I cry in the middle of the night

For the same damn thing

Because of you

I never stray too far from the sidewalk

Because of you

I learned to play on the safe side, so I dont get hurt

Because of you

I try my hardest just to forget everything

Because of you

I dont know how to let anyone else in

Because of you

Im ashamed of my life, because its empty

Because of you

I am afraid

Because of you (ooh)

Because of you (ooh, ooh)
