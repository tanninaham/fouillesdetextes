[Verse 1]
I dont know what youve been told
But time is running out, no need to take it slow
Im stepping to you toe to toe
I should be scared, honey, maybe so

[Chorus]
But I aint worried bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I aint worried bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds below

[Post Chorus]
I aint worried bout it
I aint worried bout it (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I dont know what youve been told
But time is running out so spend it like its gold
Im living like Im nine zeros
Got no regrets even when I am broke (Yeah)
Im at my best when I got something Im wanting to steal
Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)
No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal
Ill take it in and let it go

[Chorus]
But I aint worried bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I aint worried bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds below

[Post Chorus]
I aint worried bout it
I aint worried bout it (Hey)

[Bridge]
Ooh, I aint worried
Ooh, oh, no, no

[Chorus]
I aint worried bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I aint worried bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds below

[Post Chorus]
I aint worried bout it (Ooh, hey)
I aint worried bout it (Ooh, hey)

[Outro]
I aint worried bout it
