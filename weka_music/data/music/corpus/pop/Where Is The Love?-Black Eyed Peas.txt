Whats wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin like they aint got no mamas
I think the whole worlds addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things thatll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then youre bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And thats exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, yall, yall

People killin, people dyin
Children hurtin, hear them cryin
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just aint the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that dont belong?
Nations droppin bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin in? People keep on givin in
Makin wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin on, but the reasons undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Wheres the love, yall? Come on (I dont know)
And wheres the truth, yall? Come on (I dont know)
And wheres the love yall?

People killin, people dyin
Children hurtin, hear them cryin
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As Im gettin older, yall people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin
Selfishness got us followin the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
Thats the reason why sometimes Im feelin under
Thats the reason why sometimes Im feelin down
Its no wonder why sometimes Im feelin under
Gotta keep my faith alive til love is found
Now ask yourself

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

Now sing with me, yall (One world, one world)
We only got (One world, one world)
Thats all we got (One world, one world)
And somethings wrong with it (Yeah)
Somethings wrong with it (Yeah)
Somethings wrong with the w world, world, yeah
We only got (One world, one world)
Thats all we got (One world, one world)
