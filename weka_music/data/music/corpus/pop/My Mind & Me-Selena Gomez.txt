"My Mind & Me"

Wanna hear a part to my story?
I tried to hide in the glory
And sweep it under the table
So you would never know
Sometimes I feel like an accident
People look when they're passing it
Never check on the passenger
They just want the free show

Yeah, I'm constantly
Tryna fight something that my eyes can't see

My mind and me
We don't get along sometimes and it
Gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
And all of the crashing and burning and breaking, I know now
If somebody sees me like this, then they won't feel alone now
My mind and me

It's hard to talk and feel heard when you always feel like a burden
Don't wanna add to concern I know they already got
But if I pull back the curtain, then maybe someone who's hurting
Will be a little more certain they're not the only one lost

Yeah, I'm constantly
Tryna fight something that my eyes can't see

My mind and me
We don't get along sometimes and it
Gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
And all of the crashing and burning and breaking, I know now
If somebody sees me like this then they won't feel alone now
My mind and me

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
My mind and me
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah (My mind, my mind)
My mind and me
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
My mind and me
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah (Oh, it's only my mind and me)
My mind and me
