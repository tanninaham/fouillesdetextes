"The Other Side"

In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chilling
Smiling in the photo booth

But we got closer
Soon you were eating off my spoon
Youre coming over
And we would talk all afternoon

Tonight well just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, "Were going all the way."

Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side

I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know
We aint friends anymore
If we walk down this road
Well be lovers for sure
So tonight
Kiss me like its do or die
And take me to the other side

This could be perfect
But we wont know unless we try (try)
I know youre nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

Tonight well just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, "Were going all the way."

Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side

I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know
We aint friends anymore
If we walk down this road
Well be lovers for sure
So tonight
Kiss me like its do or die
And take me to the other side

Kiss me like its do or die
And take me to the other side

Tonight well just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, "Were going all the way."

Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
(Blasting through the air)
Just take me to the other side
(Take me, baby)

I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know
We aint friends anymore
(oh, no)
If we walk down this road
Well be lovers for sure
So tonight (so tonight)
Kiss me like its do or die
(kiss me, kiss me)
And take me to the other side

Take me to the other side
And take me to the other side
Kiss me like its do or die
And take me to the other side
