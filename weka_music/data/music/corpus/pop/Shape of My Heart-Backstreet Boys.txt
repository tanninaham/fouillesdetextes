Yeah, yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here dont put out the glow
Hold me now dont bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that Ive become, oh yeah
Looking back on the things Ive done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Sadness is beautiful, loneliness thats tragical
So help me I cant win this war, oh no
Touch me now, dont bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man Ive become
Looking back on the things Ive done
I was trying to be someone (trying)
I played my part, kept you in the dark (in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Im here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I dont know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart
Im lookin back on things Ive done
I never wanna play the same old part
Ill keep you in the dark (keep you in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things Ive done
I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone)
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (now let me show you the shape of my heart)
Looking back on the things Ive done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of
Show you the shape of my heart
