"When I Get There"

I think of you when I think about forever
I hear a joke and I know you would have told it better
I think of you out of the blue
When I'm watching a movie that you'd hate
And you'd say it
You were never one to hesitate

You were always first in line
So why would it be different for heaven
But I got a couple questions

Is there a bar up there
Where you've got a favorite chair
Where you sit with friends
And talk about the weather?
Is there a place you go
To watch the sunset and oh
Is there a song you just can't wait to share?
Yeah I know you'll tell me when I get there

Do you think of me? Do you wish that I would slow down?
Are there some things that you've seen that feel like home now?
Are you up there climbing trees, singing brand new melodies?
I hope you are, I know you are

Is there a bar up there
Where you've got a favorite chair
Where you sit with friends
And talk about the weather?
Is there a place you go
To watch the sunset and oh
Is there a song you just can't wait to share?
Yeah I know you'll tell me when I get there
Yeah you'll tell me when I get there

Will you save me a place with all those pearls of wisdom?
Yeah I'll make some mistakes and you'll watch me as I live them
Til I'm through, 'til I'm with you

Is there a bar up there
Where you've got a favorite chair
Where you sit with friends
And talk about, talk about the weather?
Is there a place you go
To watch the sunset and oh
Is there a song you just can't wait to share?
Yeah I know you'll tell me when I get there yeah
I think of you when I think about forever
