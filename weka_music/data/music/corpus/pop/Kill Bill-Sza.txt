[Verse 1]
Im still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if Im not the one drivin

[Pre Chorus]
Im so mature, Im so mature
Im so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me theres other men
I dont want none, I just want you
If I cant have you, no one should, I might

[Chorus]
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriends next, howd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

[Verse 2]
I get the sense that its a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmers market with your perfect peach
Now Im in amazement, playin on my patience
Now you layin face down, got me singin over a beat

[Pre Chorus]
Im so mature, Im so mature
Im so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me theres other men
I dont want none, I just want you
If I cant have you, no one will, I (I might)

[Chorus]
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriends next, howd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

[Bridge]
I did it all for love (Love)
I did it all on no drugs (Drugs)
I did all of this sober
I did it all for us, oh
I did it all for love (Love)
I did all of this on no drugs (Drugs)
I did all of this sober
Dont you know I did it all for us? (Im gon kill your ass tonight)

[Chorus]
Oh, I just killed my ex, not the best idea (Idea)
Killed his girlfriend next, howd I get here?
I just killed my ex, I still love him, though (I do)
Rather be in hell than alone
