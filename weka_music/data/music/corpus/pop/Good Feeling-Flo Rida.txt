[Chorus: Etta James]
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yes I can, doubt better leave, Im runnin with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket cant have me
Ill be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip?
Like you the one drinking what God sipâ€”dot com
Now I got a word for your tongue
How many rolling stones you want?
Yeah I got a brand new spirit
Speaking it and its done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, U.S. to Taiwan
Now who can say that? I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack
A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach
I got a feeling its a rap, ASAP
