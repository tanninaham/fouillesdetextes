Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin
Its so wonderful and warm

Breathe me in, breathe me out
I dont know if I could ever go without
Im just thinking out loud
I dont know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar

Strawberries on a summer evenin
Baby, youre the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin
Getting washed away in you

Breathe me in, breathe me out
I dont know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high

I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high

Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin
And it sounds just like a song
I want your belly and that summer feelin
I dont know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high

I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Woo)
Watermelon sugar high
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Ooh)
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
