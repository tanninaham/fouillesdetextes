Ride
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die
Til we die
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die

Its real late, bout a quarter to one
Im thinkin of everything that weve become
And I hate it, I thought we could make it
But Im ready to dead this, just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinkin you were out with your friends
Im so foolish, play me like Im stupid
Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin over and over again
Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin down
And I just cant figure out why, but this is what you said, boy

We ride
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die
Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die
Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die

Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that Ill never forget
Took me swimmin in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like Im floating, yeah
You think Im playin when you know its the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses (Kisses) and my lovin (And my lovin)
But aint nobody better than us, yeah, yeah

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin over and over again
Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin down
And I just cant figure out why you said

We ride (Mmm)
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die
Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die
Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die

I guess its over indefinitely
But you and I know its not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself cause you blew it
I wont forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride (Yeah)
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die
Til we die
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die

Gonna make you say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when Im lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride, we ride, its til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now well let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride, we ride, its til the day that we die)

We ride
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die
Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die
Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
Its til the day that we die

We ride
