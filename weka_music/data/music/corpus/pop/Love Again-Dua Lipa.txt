I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought Id hear my heart beat so loud
I cant believe theres something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that heavens right here, baby
Touch me, so I know Im not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
Id rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that heavens right here, baby
Touch me, so I know Im not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

I cant believe, I cant believe
I finally found someone
Ill sink my teeth in disbelief
Cause youre the one that I want
I cant believe, I cant believe
Im not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again

La la la, la la la
La la la, la la la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought Id hear my heart beat so loud
I cant believe theres something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
(Were in love, were in love)
(Were in love, were in love, oh, oh)

I cant believe, I cant believe
I finally found someone
Ill sink my teeth in disbelief
Cause youre the one that I want
I cant believe theres something left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again (Again and again)
Again (And again and again and again)
