Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me

"Go make yourself some friends, or youll be lonely"

Once, I was seven years old

 

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger

Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker

By 11, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor

Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was 11 years old, my daddy told me

"Go get yourself a wife, or youll be lonely"

Once, I was 11 years old

 

I always had that dream like my daddy before me

So I started writing songs, I started writing stories

Something about the glory just always seemed to bore me

Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told

Before the morning sun, when life was lonely

Once, I was 20 years old

(Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I dont believe in failure

Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major

I got my boys with me, at least those in favor

And if we dont meet before I leave, I hope Ill see you later

Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told

I was writing bout everything, I saw before me

Once, I was 20 years old

 

Soon, well be 30 years old, our songs have been sold

Weve traveled around the world, and were still roaming

Soon, well be 30 years old

 

Im still learning about life, my woman brought children for me

So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories

Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory

And some I had to leave behind, my brother, Im still sorry

Soon, Ill be 60 years old, my daddy got 61

Remember life and then your life becomes a better one

I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once

I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon, Ill be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?

Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?

Soon, Ill be 60 years old

 

Soon, Ill be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?

Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?

Soon, Ill be 60 years old
