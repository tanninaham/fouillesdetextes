What it is, Folk?
This right here is the 16 year old phenome, Chris Breezy
Me, myself, Im the 23 yr old CEO
Young Carter, Im harder then them other boys
I aint even fronting, baby I can take a summer off
I can break a woman off
I can take the stomach off, one of my trucks
Now Im riding in the goods
Line it on up, guarantee you get served
Lil Chris, said run it
So I ran and told her
Im a cash money youngn,
Bird man junior
Just a president, looking for a minor occurrence
The young boy just turned 16 and I got
6 4s and hot bikes that I rock
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock
But all that swinging in that bikini just make him dizzy
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop
Cause you speaking that slang that I talk
That sassy tempo with that walk,
May be the reason that all this teenies may never see me
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the lac
You could be in the back saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the lac
You could be in the back saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)
Ma, take a break, let me explain to you
What ya body got a young boy ready to do
If you take a chance, and let me put them things on you
I could show you why I make them straight As in school
Im a HUSTLA!
Trust my frame and age
Got you thinking that Im just too young to turn your page
I can PICTURE!
Us switching lanes in the coupe
With you on the phone screaming my name
(Chris!)
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the lac,
You could be in the back saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)

Okay
Weezy baby, baby what it do, Im try to holla at you
I aint upset, but Ill blind you if I smile at you
You rockn wit young Chris and the best rapper
So leave your phone, bring your friends, let the rest happen
A lil Patron, a lil Hen, Im on Cavalli Vodka
Im in Cavalli jeans, got on Cavalli boxers
Im fresher than a newborn
And um, I can work you out like a futon
And um, you can leave your birthday suit on
Ima leave my boots on
Ima leave my jewels on
Never know what you want
Ima leave that tool on
Never know who home
I learned that from a Biggy song
On to a new one
Some like a redbone
Ohh I think she like me, she got me on a ringtone
And I told her, "Get yours, girl and dont you stop"
Now gimme that funk, that gushy stuff
(OH!)
