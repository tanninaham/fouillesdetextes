"Moves Like Jagger"
(feat. Christina Aguilera)

[Adam Levine:]
Oh
Oh

Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right, then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away
And make it OK
I swear Ill behave
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now Im naked
You say Im a kid
My ego is big
I dont give a shit
And it goes like this, uh

Take me by the tongue and Ill know you (Uh)
Kiss me til youre drunk and Ill show you
You want the moves like Jagger
Ive got them moves like Jagger
Ive got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I dont need to try to control you (Uh)
Look into my eyes and Ill own you
With them moves like Jagger
Ive got them moves like Jagger
Ive got them moves like Jagger

Maybe its hard, when you feel like
Youre broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when youre with me
Ill make you believe
That Ive got the key
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but Im shifting gears
Ill take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And it goes like this, uh

[Adam Levine {Christina Aguilera}:]

[Christina Aguilera {Adam Levine}:]
Uh, you wanna know, how to make me smile?
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
Youre gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this (Uh)
So watch and learn, I wont show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right, yeah
And if I share my secret
Youre gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
{And it goes like this, uh}
