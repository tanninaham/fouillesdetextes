"This Town"

Waking up to kiss you and nobodys there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
Its hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
Its funny how things never change in this old town
So far
From the stars

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching Id still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Mmmmm

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met hes got his arms around you
Its so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

Cause if the whole world was watching Id still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when Im next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

And I know that its wrong
That I cant move on
But theres something bout you

Cause if the whole world was watching Id still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when Im next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Mmmm
Everything comes back to you
Mmmm
