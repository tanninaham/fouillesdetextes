I could lift you up

I could show you what you wanna see

And take you where you wanna be

You could be my luck

Even if the sky is falling down

I know that well be safe and sound

Were safe and sound



I could fill your cup

You know my river wont evaporate

This world we still appreciate

You could be my luck

Even in a hurricane of frowns

I know that well be safe and sound

(Safe and sound)

Were safe and sound

(Safe and sound)

Were safe and sound

(Hold your ground)

Were safe and sound

(Safe and sound)

I could show you love

In a tidal wave of mystery

Youll still be standing next to me

You could be my luck

Even if were six feet underground

I know that well be safe and sound



Were safe and sound



Safe and sound

Safe and sound

Hold your ground

Safe and sound

I could lift you up

I could show you what you wanna see

And take you where you wanna be

You could be my luck

Even if the sky is falling down

I know that well be safe and sound

I could lift you up

I could show you what you wanna see

And take you where you wanna be

You could be my luck

Even if the sky is falling down

I know that well be safe and sound

Were safe and sound

Were safe and sound

Were safe and sound

Were safe and sound

(Safe and sound)

Were safe and sound

(Safe and sound)

Were safe and sound

(Hold your ground)

Were safe and sound

(Safe and sound)

Were safe and sound
