Youll say, "Weve got nothing in common

No common ground to start from"

And were falling apart

Youll say, "The world has come between us

Our lives have come between us"

Still I know you just dont care

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffanys?"

She said, "I think I remember the film"

And as I recall I think we both kinda liked it

And I said, "Well, thats the one thing weve got"

 

I see you, the only one who knew me

And now your eyes see through me

I guess I was wrong

 

So what now? Its plain to see were over

And I hate when things are over

When so much is left undone

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffanys?"

She said, "I think I remember the film"

And as I recall I think we both kinda liked it

And I said, "Well, thats the one thing weve got"

Youll say, "That weve got nothing in common

No common ground to start from"

And were falling apart

Youll say, "The world has come between us

Our lives have come between us"

Still I know you just dont care

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffanys?"

She said, "I think I remember the film"

And as I recall I think we both kinda liked it

And I said, "Well, thats the one thing weve got"

 

Ooh, and I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffanys?"

She said, "I think I remember the film"

And as I recall I think we both kinda liked it

And I said, "Well, thats the one thing weve got"

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffanys?"

She said, "I think I remember the film"

And as I recall I think we both kinda liked it

And I said, "Well, thats the one thing weve got"
