I was a liar, I gave in to the fire

I know I shouldve fought it, at least Im being honest

Feel like a failure, cause I know that I failed you

I shouldve done you better, cause you dont want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything

But boy, I couldnt give it to you

And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything

But I got nothing here without you

So one last time

I need to be the one who takes you home

One more time

I promise after that, Ill let you go

Baby, I dont care if you got her in your heart

All I really care is you wake up in my arms

One last time

I need to be the one who takes you home

I dont deserve it, I know I dont deserve it

But stay with me a minute, I swear Ill make it worth it

Cant you forgive me? At least just temporarily

I know that this is my fault, I shouldve been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything

But boy, I couldnt give it to you

And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything

But I got nothing here without you, baby

So one last time

I need to be the one who takes you home

One more time

I promise after that, Ill let you go

Baby, I dont care if you got her in your heart

All I really care is you wake up in my arms

One last time

I need to be the one who takes you home

I know I shouldve fought it, at least Im being honest, yeah

But stay with me a minute, I swear Ill make it worth it, babe

Cause I dont wanna be without ya

So one last time

I need to be the one who takes you home (babe)

One more time

I promise after that, Ill let you go

Baby, I dont care if you got her in your heart, babe

All I really care is you wake up in my arms

One last time

I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah

One last time

I need to be the one who takes you home
