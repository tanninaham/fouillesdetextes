 Cause youre a sky,  cause youre a sky full of stars

Im gonna give you my heart

 Cause you re a sky,  cause yo re a sky full of stars

 Cause you light up the path

I dont care, go on and tear me apart

I dont care if you do, ooh ooh, ooh

 Cause in a sky,  cause in a sky full of stars

I think I saw you

 

 Cause you re a sky,  cause youre a sky full of stars

I wanna die in your arms, oh, oh oh

 Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark

Im gonna give you my heart, oh

I dont care, go on and tear me apart

I dont care if you do, ooh ooh, ooh

 Cause in a sky,  cause in a sky full of stars

I think I see you

I think I see you

 

 Cause youre a sky, youre a sky full of stars

Such a heavenly view

Youre such a heavenly view

Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
