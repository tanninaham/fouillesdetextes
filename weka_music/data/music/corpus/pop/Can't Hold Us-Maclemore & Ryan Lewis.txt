Hey, hey, hey

Good to see you

Come on, dude, lets go

Yeah! Lets go!

Ha ha ha ha alright

Alright, okay

Uh, alright, okay

Alright, okay

Return of the Mack

Get em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isnt

Looking for a better way to get up out of bed

Instead of getting on the Internet

And checking on who hit me, get up

Thrift shop, pimp strut walkin

Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious

Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby

Sweater game, nope nope, yall cant copy

Yeah, bad, moonwalking, this here is our party

My posses been on Broadway, and we did it our way

Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones

Into everything I record to it and yet Im on

Let that stage light go and shine on down

Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style

Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds

But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, on my I N D E P E N D E N T shit, hustlin

Chasing dreams since I was 14

With the four track, bussin

Halfway cross that city with the backpack

Fat cat, crushing labels out here, nah, they cant tell me nothin

We give that to the people, spread it across the country

Labels out here, nah, they cant tell me nothin

We give it to the people, spread it across the country

Can we go back? This is the moment

Tonight is the night, well fight til its over

So we put our hands up

Like the ceiling cant hold us

Like the ceiling cant hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment

Tonight is the night, well fight til its over

So we put our hands up

Like the ceiling cant hold us

Like the ceiling cant hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you

Yeah, Im so damn grateful

I grew up really wanting gold fronts

But thats what you get when Wu Tang raised you

Yall cant stop me

Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat

And Im eating at the beat like you gave a little speed

To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!

Time to go off, Im gone

Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see

And my girl, she wanna see Rome

Caesarll make you a believer

Nah, I never ever did it for a throne

That validation comes from giving it back to the people

Now sing a song, and it goes like

Raise those hands, this is our party

We came here to live life like nobody was watching

I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me

Learn from that failure, gain humility

And then we keep marching, I said...

Can we go back? This is the moment

Tonight is the night, well fight til its over

So we put our hands up

Like the ceiling cant hold us

Like the ceiling cant hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment

Tonight is the night, well fight til its over

So we put our hands up

Like the ceiling cant hold us

Like the ceiling cant hold us
