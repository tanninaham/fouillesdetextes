And another one bites the dust

Oh, why can I not conquer love?

And I mightve thought that we were one

Wanted to fight this war without weapons

And I wanted it, and I wanted it bad

But there were so many red flags

Now another one bites the dust

Yeah, lets be clear Ill trust no one

You did not break me

Im still fighting for peace

Ive got thick skin and an elastic heart

But your blade it might be too sharp

Im like a rubber band until you pull too hard

I may snap and I move fast

But you wont see me fall apart

Cause Ive got an elastic heart

Ive got an elastic heart

Yeah, Ive got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night

Lets be clear, wont close my eyes

And I know that I can survive

Ill walk through fire to save my life

And I want it, I want my life so bad

Im doing everything I can

Then another one bites the dust

Its hard to lose a chosen one

You did not break me

Im still fighting for peace

Ive got thick skin and an elastic heart

But your blade it might be too sharp

Im like a rubber band until you pull too hard

I may snap and I move fast

But you wont see me fall apart

Cause Ive got an elastic heart

Ive got thick skin and an elastic heart

But your blade it might be too sharp

Im like a rubber band until you pull too hard

I may snap and I move fast

But you wont see me fall apart

Cause Ive got an elastic heart

Ive got thick skin and an elastic heart

But your blade it might be too sharp

Im like a rubber band until you pull too hard

And I may snap and I move fast

But you wont see me fall apart

Cause Ive got an elastic heart

Ive got an elastic heart
