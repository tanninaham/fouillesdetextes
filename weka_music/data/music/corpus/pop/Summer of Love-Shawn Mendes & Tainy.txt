Kisses on your body were like heaven we were taking it slow
Tangled in the sheets until the evening there was nowhere to go, yeah
We were in a daze, learning each other shapes
Tracing shadows of rain down your back, oh
Kisses on your body in my memory baby nothing comes close

It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love, yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love

Meditation and tequila
Calling you my senorita
Didnt know how much I need ya
Hate it when I have to leave ya
Ive been taking mental pictures
For when I miss you in the winter
Staying up until the sunrise
Praying it wont be the last time

It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love, yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love

Kisses on your body were like heaven we were taking it slow, yeah
Entangled in the sheets until the evening there was nowhere to go, no

It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love, yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love
It was the summer of
