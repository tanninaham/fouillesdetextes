"Payphone"
(feat. Wiz Khalifa)

Im at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, its all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know its hard to remember
The people we used to be
Its even harder to picture
That youre not here next to me

You say its too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

Ive wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now Im paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

Im at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, its all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
[Explicit:] All those fairy tales are full of shit
[Clean:] All those fairy tales are full of it
[Explicit:] One more fucking love song, Ill be sick
[Clean:] One more stupid love song, Ill be sick

Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away

You cant expect me to be fine (Oh oh)
I dont expect you to care (Yeah)
I know Ive said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

Ive wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now Im paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "love"
But even the sun sets in paradise

Im at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Oh, oh oh oh)
Where have the times gone? Baby, its all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)

If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
[Explicit:] All those fairy tales are full of shit
[Clean:] All those fairy tales are full of it
[Explicit:] One more fucking love song, Ill be sick (Yeah, uh)
[Clean:] One more stupid love song, Ill be sick, oh
Now Im at a payphone

[Clean radio version verse:]
Yeah, yeah, now baby dont hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
Baby Im begging you just please dont go
So I can tell you what you need to know

[Explicit version verse (Wiz Khalifa):]
Man, fuck that shit
Ill be out spending all this money
While youre sitting round wondering
Why it wasnt you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me Im stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Dont need my name on my shirt
You can tell that Im balling
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say its over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wished Id go away, got what you was looking for
Now its me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you (Yeah)

Im at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Woo)
Where have the times gone? Baby, its all wrong (Yeah)
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)

If "Happy Ever After" did exist (Oh)
I would still be holding you like this
[Explicit:] All those fairy tales are full of shit (Yeah)
[Clean:] All those fairy tales are full of it
[Explicit:] One more fucking love song, Ill be sick, oh
[Clean:] One more stupid love song, Ill be sick, yeah
Now Im at a payphone
