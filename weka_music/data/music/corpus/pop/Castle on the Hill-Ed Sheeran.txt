When I was six years old, I broke my leg

When I was running from my brother and his friends

And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down

Well, I was younger then, take me back to when

I found my heart and broke it here

Made friends and lost them through the years

And Ive not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know Ive grown

But I cant wait to go home

Im on my way

Driving at 90 down those country lanes

Singing to "Tiny Dancer"

And I miss the way you make me feel, and its real

And we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

 

15 years old and smoking hand rolled cigarettes

Running from the law through the backfields

And getting drunk with my friends

Had my first kiss on a Friday night

I dont reckon that I did it right

But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid

Wed buy cheap spirits and drink them straight

Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how weve grown

But I cant wait to go home

Im on my way (hoo hoo)

Driving at 90 down those country lanes (hoo hoo)

Singing to "Tiny Dancer"

And I miss the way you make me feel, and its real

And we watched the sunset (hoo hoo), over the castle on the hill

Hoo hoo, over the castle on the hill

Hoo hoo, over the castle on the hill

 

One friend left to sell clothes, one works down by the coast

One had two kids but lives alone, ones brother overdosed

Ones already on his second wife, ones just barely getting by

But these people raised me and I cant wait to go home

And Im on my way

I still remember these old country lanes

When we did not know the answers

And I miss the way (hoo hoo) you make me feel, its real

When we watched the sunset (hoo hoo) over the castle on the hill

Hoo hoo, over the castle on the hill

Hoo hoo, over the castle on the hill
