Tell me how Im supposed to breathe with no air
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh

If I should die before I wake
Its cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh
Im here alone, didnt wanna leave
My heart wont move, its incomplete
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand

But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me?
Cause my world revolves around you
Its so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how Im supposed to breathe with no air
Cant live, cant breathe with no air
Thats how I feel whenever you aint there
Theres no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how youre gon be without me
If you aint here, I just cant breathe
Theres no air, no air

No air, air (Oh oh)
No air, air (No)
No air, air (Oh oh)
No air, air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
Theres no gravity to hold me down for real
But somehow, Im still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I dont know how, but I dont even care

So how (How) do you expect me (Me)
To live alone with just me? (Oh, oh)
Cause my world revolves around you
Its so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how Im supposed to breathe with no air (Oh oh, oh oh)
Cant live, cant breathe with no air (Oh oh, oh oh)
Thats how I feel whenever you aint there
Theres no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep (So deep)
Tell me how youre gon be without me (Without me, yeah)
If you aint here, I just cant breathe
Theres no air, no air

No air, air (Oh, ooh ooh)
No air, air (Oh, ooh ooh)
No air, air (No, no)
No air, air

No more
(No, no, no, no air)
(No, no, no air) Ooh ooh, baby
(No, no, no air) Oh woah
Theres no air, no air
Hey (No air), ooh
No air (No, no, no air), oh
(No, no, aint there) Oh oh

Tell me how Im supposed to breathe with no air (No air)
Cant live, cant breathe (Oh woah) with no air (No air)
Thats how I feel whenever you aint there (No breathing)
Theres no air, no air (No breathing, oh)
Got me out here in the water so deep (So deep)
Tell me how youre gon be without me (Without me, yeah)
If you aint here, I just cant breathe (Cant breathe without you, baby)
Theres no air, no air

To live alone with just me
