The moon is high

Like your friends were the night that we first met

Went home and tried to stalk you on the Internet

Now Ive read all of the books beside your bed

The wine is cold

Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street

Cat and mouse for a month or two or three

Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

(Ayy)

Kiss me once cause you know I had a long night (oh)

Kiss me twice cause its gonna be alright (uh)

Three times cause Ive waited my whole life (one, two, one, two, three, four)

I like shiny things, but Id marry you with paper rings

Uh huh, thats right

Darling, youre the one I want, and

I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this

Uh huh, thats right

Darling, youre the one I want

In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams

Oh, youre the one I want

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool

When you jumped in first, I went in too

Im with you, even if it makes me blue, which takes me back

To the color that we painted your brothers wall

Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws

We wouldnt be standing here so tall, so

(Ayy)

Kiss you once cause I know you had a long night (oh)

Kiss you twice cause its gonna be alright (uh)

Three times cause you waited your whole life (one, two, one, two, three, four), aah

I like shiny things, but Id marry you with paper rings

Uh huh, thats right

Darling, youre the one I want, and

I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this

Uh huh, thats right

Darling, youre the one I want

In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams

Oh, youre the one I want

I want to drive away with you

I want your complications too

I want your dreary Mondays

Wrap your arms around me, baby boy

I want to drive away with you

I want your complications too

I want your dreary Mondays

Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
 
Uh huh

I like shiny things, but Id marry you with paper rings

Ah ah, thats right

Youre the one I want

I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this

Ah ah, darling, youre the one I want

I like shiny things, but Id marry you with paper rings

Uh huh, thats right

Darling, youre the one I want, and

I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this

Uh huh, thats right

Darling, youre the one I want

In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams

Youre the one I want

In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams

Oh, youre the one I want

Youre the one I want, one I want

Youre the one I want...
