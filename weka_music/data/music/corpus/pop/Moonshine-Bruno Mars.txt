Hello
You know you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips you know I started to feel wonderful
Its something incredible, theres sex in your chemicals
Ooh, lets go
Youre the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world aint for you, and I know for damn sure this world aint for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free
Oh

Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

I know, I was with you last night but it feels like its been so long
And everybody thats around they know that Im not myself when youre gone
Its good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world, is where I stand when youre back in my life
Lifes not so bad when youre way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright

Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, oh

Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

Dont look down, dont you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Lets take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, oh

Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
