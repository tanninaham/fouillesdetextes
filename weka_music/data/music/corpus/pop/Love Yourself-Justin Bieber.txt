For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness sake
You think Im cryin on my own. Well, I aint

And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care. I dont
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job
Didnt see whats going on
But now I know
Im better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care. I dont
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job
Didnt see whats going on
But now I know
Im better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love. Now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think (you think) that Im (that Im) still holdin on (holdin on) to somethin
You should go and love yourself
