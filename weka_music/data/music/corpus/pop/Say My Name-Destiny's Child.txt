Say my name, say my name

If no one is around you, say, "Baby I love you"

If you aint runnin game

Say my name, say my name

You acting kind of shady, aint callin me baby

Why the sudden change?

Say my name, say my name

If no one is around you, say, "Baby I love you"

If you aint runnin game

Say my name, say my name

You acting kind of shady, aint callin me baby

Betta say my name

Any other day I would call, you would say

"Baby hows your day?" But today it aint the same

Every other word is "Uh huh", "Yeah okay"

Could it be that you are at the crib wit another lady?

If you took it there, first of all let me say

I am not the one to sit around and be played

So prove yourself to me, that Im the girl that you cravin

Why dont you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

I know you sayin that Im assuming things

Somethings goin down thats the way it seems

Shouldnt be no reason, why youre acting strange?

Nobodys holding you back from me

Cause I know how you usually do

When you sayin everything to me times two

Why cant you just tell the truth?

If somebodys there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name

If no one is around you, say, "Baby I love you"

If you aint runnin game

You acting kind of shady, aint callin me baby

Why the sudden change?

Say my name, say my name

If no one is around you, say, "Baby I love you"

If you aint runnin game

You acting kind of shady, aint callin me baby

Betta say my name

What is up wit this, tell the truth who you with?

How would you like it if I came over wit my clique?

Dont try to change it now, say you got to bounce

When two seconds ago you said you just got in the house

Its hard to believe that you were home by yourself

When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else

Just this question, why do you feel you got to lie?

Gettin caught up in your game, where you cannot say my name

I know you sayin that Im assuming things

Somethings goin down thats the way it seems

Shouldnt be no reason, why youre acting strange?

If nobodys holding you back from me

Cause I know how you usually do

When you sayin everything to me times two

Why cant you just tell the truth?

If somebodys there tell me who

Say my name, say my name
