Im still a fan even though I was salty

Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy

Hate to see you happy if Im not the one driving

Im so mature, Im so mature

Im so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me theres other men

I dont want none, I just want you

If I cant have you, no one should

I might

I might kill my ex, not the best idea

His new girlfriends next, howd I get here?

I might kill my ex, I still love him though

Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that its a lost cause

I get the sense that you might really love her

The text gon be evidence, this text is evidence

I tried to ration with you, no murders or crimes of passion, but damn

You was out of reach

You was at the farmers market with your perfect peach

Now Im in the basement, planning home invasion

Now you laying face down, got me singing over a beat

Im so mature, Im so mature

Im so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me theres other men

I dont want none, I just want you

If I cant have you, no one will

(I might)

I might kill my ex, not the best idea

His new girlfriends next, howd I get here?

I might kill my ex, I still love him though

Rather be in jail than alone

I did it all for love (love)

I did it all on no drugs (drugs)

I did all of this sober

I did it all for us, oh

I did it all for love (love)

I did it all of this on no drugs (drugs)

I did all of this sober

Dont you know I did it all for us? (Ill kill your ass tonight)

Uh, I just killed my ex (my ex)

Not the best idea (idea)

Killed his girlfriend next, howd I get here?

I just killed my ex (my ex)

I still love him, though (I do)

Rather be in Hell than alone
