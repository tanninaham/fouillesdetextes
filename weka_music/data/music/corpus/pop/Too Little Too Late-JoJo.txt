Come with me
Stay the night
You say the words but boy it dont feel right
What do you expect me to say
(You know its just too little too late)

You take my hand
And you say youve changed
But boy you know your begging dont fool me
Because to you its just a game
(You know its just too little too late)

So let me on now
Cause time has made me strong
Im starting to move on
Im gonna say this now
Your chance has come and gone
And you know

Its just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I cant wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know its just too little too late)
You say you dream of my face
But you dont like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesnt matter anyway
(You know its just too little too late)

Its just too little too late

I was young and in love
I gave you everything
But it wasnt enough
And now you wanna communicate
(You know its just too little too late)

Go find someone else
Im letting you go
Im loving myself
You got a problem
But dont come asking me for help
Cause you know

Its just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I cant wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know its just too little too late)

You say you dream of my face
But you dont like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesnt matter anyway
(You know its just too little too late)

I can love with all of my heart, baby
I know I have so much to give
(I have so much to give)
With a player like you I dont have a prayer
Thats no way to live, no, no

Its just too little too late

Its just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I cant wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know its just too little too late)

You say you dream of my face
But you dont like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesnt matter anyway
(You know its just too little too late)

You know its just too little too late
I cant wait, no, no, no

Its just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I cant wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know its just too little too late)

You say you dream of my face
But you dont like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesnt matter anyway
(You know its just too little too late)
