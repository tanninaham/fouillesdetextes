On the other side of a street I knew

Stood a girl that looked like you

I guess thats déjà vu

But I thought this cant be true cause

You moved to west L.A., or New York or Santa Fe

Or wherever, to get away from me

Oh, but that one night, was more than just right

I didnt leave you cause I was all through

Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly scared as hell

Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you, Ill be there for you

This is not a drive by

Just a shy guy, looking for a two ply Hefty bag

To hold my love

When you move me, everything is groovy

They dont like it sue me, mhmm the way you do me

Oh, I swear to you, Ill be there for you

This is not a drive by

On the upside of a downward spiral

My love for you went viral

And I loved you every mile you drove away

But now here you are again

So lets skip the, "How you been?"

And get down to the "More than friends" at last

Oh, but that one night, is still the highlight

I didnt need you, until I came to

And I was overwhelmed, and frankly scared as hell

Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you, Ill be there for you

This is not a drive by

Just a shy guy, looking for a twoply Hefty bag

To hold my love

When you move me, everything is groovy

They dont like it sue me, mhmm the way you do me

Oh, I swear to you, Ill be there for you

This is not a drive by

Please believe that when I leave

Theres nothing up my sleeve but love for you

And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew

Stood a girl that looked like you

I guess thats déjà vu

But I thought this cant be true, cause

Oh, I swear to you, Ill be there for you

This is not a drive by

Just a shy guy, looking for a twoply Hefty bag

To hold my love

When you move me, everything is groovy

They dont like it sue me, mhmm the way you do me

Oh, I swear to you, Ill be there for you

This is not a drive by
