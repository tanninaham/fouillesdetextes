Im at a payphone, trying to call home

All of my change I spent on you

Where have the times gone? Baby, its all wrong

Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know its hard to remember

The people we used to be

Its even harder to picture

That youre not here next to me

You say its too late to make it

But is it too late to try?

And in our time that you wasted

All of our bridges burned down

Ive wasted my nights

You turned out the lights

Now, Im paralyzed

Still stuck in that time

When we called it love

But even the sun sets in paradise

Im at a payphone, trying to call home

All of my change I spent on you

Where have the times gone? Baby, its all wrong

Where are the plans we made for two?

If "Happy Ever After" did exist

I would still be holding you like this

All those fairy tales are full of shit

One more fucking love song, Ill be sick (oh)

You turned your back on tomorrow

Cause you forgot yesterday

I gave you my love to borrow

But you just gave it away

You cant expect me to be fine

I dont expect you to care

I know Ive said it before

But all of our bridges burned down

Ive wasted my nights

You turned out the lights

Now, Im paralyzed

Still stuck in that time

When we called it love

But even the sun sets in paradise

Im at a payphone, trying to call home

All of my change I spent on you (oh, oh)

Where have the times gone? Baby, its all wrong

Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)

If "Happy Ever After" did exist

I would still be holding you like this

And all those fairy tales are full of shit

One more fucking love song, Ill be sick (uh)

Now, Im at a payphone

Man, fuck that shit

Ill be out spending all this money while you sitting round

Wondering why it wasnt you who came up from nothing

Made it from the bottom, now, when you see me, Im stunning

And all of my cars start with a push of a button

Telling me had chances I blew up or whatever you call it

Switch the number to my phone, so you never could call it

Dont need my name on my show, you can tell that Im balling

Swish, what a shame could have got picked

Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot

So you talk about who you see at the top

Or what you couldve saw, but sad to say, its over for

Phantom pulled up, valet open doors

Wished Id go away, got what you was looking for

Now, its me who they want, so you can go

And take that little piece of shit with you

Im at a payphone, trying to call home

All of my change I spent on you (woo)

Where have the times gone? Baby, its all wrong

Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah, yeah)

If "Happy Ever After" did exist (oh, yeah)

I would still be holding you like this

All these fairy tales are full of shit

Yeah, one more fucking love song, Ill be sick (yeah)

Now, Im at a payphone
