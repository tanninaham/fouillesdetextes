Sha la la la la la la
Mmm
Uh huh
I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black haired flamenco dancer
You know she dances while his father plays guitar
Shes suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful
So come dance the silence down through the morning
Sha la la la la la la, yeah
Uh huh, yeah
Cut up, Maria
Show me some of them Spanish dances
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
Cause I wanna be someone who believes
Yeah
Mr. Jones and me
Tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
Shes looking at you
Ah, no, no, shes looking at me
Smilin in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you
You can never be lonely
Well, Im gon paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play
Mr. Jones and me
Looked into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
Shes looking at you
I dont think so
Shes looking at me
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me
I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely
Said Im never gonna be lonely
I wanna be a lion
Yeah, everybody wanna pass as cats
We all wanna be big, big stars
Yeah, but we got different reasons for that
Believe in me
Cause I dont believe in anything
And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe
Yeah
Mr. Jones and me
Stumbling through the barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
Shes perfect for you
Man, theres got to be somebody for me
I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, ah son
Thats just about as funky as you can be
Mr. Jones and me
Staring at the video
When I look at the television, I want to see me
Staring right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we dont know why, and we dont know how
But when everybody loves me
Im wanna be just about as happy as I can be
Mr. Jones and me
Were gonna be big stars
