You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies

Lit up the world as I fell asleep

Cause theyd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere

Youd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

Id like to make myself believe

That Planet Earth turns slowly

Its hard to say that Id rather stay awake when Im asleep

Cause everything is never as it seems

Cause Id get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs

As they tried to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed

A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

Id like to make myself believe

That Planet Earth turns slowly

Its hard to say that Id rather stay awake when Im asleep

Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack (please, take me away from here)

Cause I feel like such an insomniac (please, take me away from here)

Why do I tire of counting sheep (please, take me away from here)

When Im far too tired to fall asleep?

To ten million fireflies

Im weird cause I hate goodbyes

I got misty eyes as they said farewell (they said farewell)

But Ill know where several are

If my dreams get real bizarre

Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar

Id like to make myself believe

That Planet Earth turns slowly

Its hard to say that Id rather stay awake when Im asleep

Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

Id like to make myself believe

That Planet Earth turns slowly

Its hard to say that Id rather stay awake when Im asleep

Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

Id like to make myself believe

That Planet Earth turns slowly

Its hard to say that Id rather stay awake when Im asleep

Because my dreams are bursting at the seams
