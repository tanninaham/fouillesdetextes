Ask me about me again
You know it hurts to feel it
You should read between these
Ask me about me again
Even when my heart declines
Nothing works when I dont
Go head, try me
Cause Im safe behind these walls
Think you can take me through the fog where Im no challenge
Childish, childish
Yeah, you, you can try me
Ive changed?
Theres only been one thing that Ive changed
Nothin is ever enough
I dont have to tell you what Ive changed, oh oh, no
Cause I couldnt tell you that Ive changed (changed)
Theres only been one thing that has changed (changed, changed)
Nothin is ever enough (changed)
I dont have to tell you what Ive changed, no oh, no (changed, changed)
Cause I couldnt tell you that
Wait, I think too fast at times
I try to keep it out
But it dont work even though I try to forget that
Even though I try to forget that
I know that its hard to ignore it
I know that its heartless to play me
Go head, try me
Ive changed?
Theres only been one thing that Ive changed
Nothin is ever enough
I dont have to tell you what Ive changed, oh oh, no
Cause I couldnt tell you that Ive changed (changed)
Only been one thing that has changed, changed, changed
Nothin is ever enough (changed)
I dont have to tell you what Ive changed, no oh (changed, changed)
Cause I couldnt tell you that
Hoping Ive learned
Take back your word
Might hurt, but I wont hide
I know myself (I know myself), I know I wasnt
The only one that has been through what I have today
Can you wait for this second?
To please somebody else other than your needs (somebody else)
Youve got a lot left under your seas (under your seas, yeah)
But your hearts not on your sleeve
Try to believe me though
Gotta listen, gotta learn, gotta live, gotta fight, gotta earn
And your minds made up on me
I said your minds made up on me
Gotta live, gotta learn
