Call it love and devotion
Call it the moms adoration (foundation)
A special bond of creation, hah
For all the single mums out there
Going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean Da Paul, Anne Marie, sing, make them hear
She works the night, by the water
Shes gonna stress, so far away from her fathers daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
Shes got to save him (daily struggle)
She tells him "ooh love
No ones ever gonna hurt you, love"
"Im gonna give you all of my love"
"Nobody matters like you" (stay up there, stay up there)
She tells him "your life aint gonna be nothing like my life" (straight)
"Youre gonna grow and have a good life"
"Im gonna do what Ive got to do" (stay up there, stay up there)
