Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me, that werent all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now youve been talking in your sleep oh oh
Things you never say to me oh oh
Tell me that youve had enough
Of our love, our love
Just give me a reason, just a little bits enough
Just a second were not broken just bent, and we can learn to love again
Its in the stars, its been written in the scars on our hearts
Were not broken just bent, and we can learn to love again
Im sorry I dont understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine (oh we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everythin
And its all in your mind (yeah but this is happenin)
Youve been havin real bad dreams oh oh
You used to lie so close to me oh oh
Theres nothing more than empty sheets between our love, our love
Oh our love, our love
Just give me a reason, just a little bits enough
Just a second were not broken just bent and we can learn to love again
I never stop, youre still written in the scars on my heart
Youre not broken just bent and we can learn to love again
Oh tear ducts and rust
Ill fix it for us
Were collecting dust, but our loves enough
Youre holding it in
Youre pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
Well come clean
Just give me a reason just a little bits enough
Just a second were not broken just bent and we can learn to love again
Its in the stars, its been written in the scars on our hearts
That were not broken just bent and we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason, just a little bits enough
Just a second were not broken just bent, and we can learn to love again
Its in the stars, its been written in the scars on our hearts
That were not broken just bent, and we can learn to love again
Oh we can learn to love again
Oh we can learn to love again
Oh that were not broken just bent and we can learn to love again
