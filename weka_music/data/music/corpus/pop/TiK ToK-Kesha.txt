Wake up in the mornin feelin like P Diddy (hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, Im out the door, Im gonna hit this city (lets go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
Cause when I leave for the night, I aint comin back
Im talkin pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin up our phones, phones
Drop toppin, playin our favorite CDs
Pullin up to the parties
Tryna get a little bit tipsy
Dont stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Ima fight
Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party dont stop, no
Oh, whoa, whoa oh
Oh, whoa, whoa oh
Dont stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Ima fight
Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party dont stop, no
Oh, whoa, whoa oh
Oh, whoa, whoa oh
Aint got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
Aint got no money in my pocket, but Im already here
And now the dudes are linin up cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger
Im talkin bout everybody gettin crunk, crunk
Boys try to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he gettin too drunk, drunk
Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po po shut us down
Dont stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Ima fight
Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party dont stop, no
Oh, whoa, whoa oh
Oh, whoa, whoa oh
Dont stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Ima fight
Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party dont stop, no
Oh, whoa, whoa oh
Oh, whoa, whoa oh
DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me
With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me
DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me
With my hands up
Put your hands up

Now, the party dont start til I walk in
Dont stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Ima fight
Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party dont stop, no
Oh, whoa, whoa oh
Oh, whoa, whoa oh
Dont stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Ima fight
Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party dont stop, no
Oh, whoa, whoa oh
