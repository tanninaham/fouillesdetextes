Its gettin late, Im making my way over to my favorite place

I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away

I wasnt looking for nobody when you looked my way

Possible candidate, yeah

Who knew that youd be up in here lookin like you do?

Youre making stayin over here impossible

Baby, Ima say your aura is incredible

If you dont have to go, dont

Do you know what you started? I just came here to party

But now were rockin on the dance floor, actin naughty

Your hands around my waist, just let the music play

Were hand in hand, chest to chest, and now were face to face

I wanna take you away

Lets escape into the music, DJ, let it play

I just cant refuse it, like the way you do this

Keep on rockin to it

Please dont stop the, please dont stop the music

I wanna take you away

Lets escape into the music, DJ, let it play

I just cant refuse it, like the way you do this

Keep on rockin to it

Please dont stop the, please dont stop the, please dont stop the music

Baby, are you ready? Cause its getting close

Dont you feel the passion ready to explode?

What goes on between us, no one has to know

This is a private show, oh

Do you know what you started? I just came here to party

But now were rockin on the dance floor, actin naughty

Your hands around my waist, just let the music play

Were hand in hand, chest to chest, and now, were face to face

I wanna take you away

Lets escape into the music, DJ, let it play

I just cant refuse it, like the way you do this

Keep on rockin to it

Please dont stop the, please dont stop the music

I wanna take you away

Lets escape into the music, DJ, let it play

I just cant refuse it, like the way you do this

Keep on rockin to it

Please dont stop the, please dont stop the, please dont stop the music
