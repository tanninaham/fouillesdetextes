First things first, Ima say all the words inside my head

Im fired up, and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh

The way that things have been, oh ooh

Second thing second, dont you tell me what you think that I can be

Im the one at the sail, Im the master of my sea, oh ooh

The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age

Taking my sulking to the masses

Writing my poems for the few

That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin me

Singing from heartache from the pain

Taking my message from the veins

Speaking my lesson from the brain

Seeing the beauty through the

Pain!

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Pain!

You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer

Pain!

Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

My life, my love, my drive it came from

Pain!

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above

All the hate that youve heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh

Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd

Building my rain up in the cloud

Falling like ashes to the ground

Hoping my feelings, they would drown

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin and flowin

Inhibited, limited, til it broke open, and it rained down

It rained down like

Pain!

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Pain!

You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer

Pain!

Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

My life, my love, my drive it came from

Pain!

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames

Youre the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh

The blood in my veins, oh ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin and flowin

Inhibited, limited, til it broke open, and it rained down

It rained down like

Pain!

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

 

Pain!

You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer

Pain!

Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

My life, my love, my drive it came from

Pain!

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
