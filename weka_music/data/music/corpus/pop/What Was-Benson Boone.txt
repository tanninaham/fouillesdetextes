"What Was"

Young, standing on the edge of 21
Staring at the man that I become sometimes
When I lose my control
He's dumb, if you blink he'll blow up like a gun
Jumping to conclusions just for fun
That guy, needs somebody to hold
Needs somebody he knows

Where the hell did she go?
It kinda makes me feel like

I wish I could change my name
I wish I could start again
Fly me to a lonely place
Where you'll never see my face
So you'll never feel the pain of
What was
When you're standing in the rain
Calling out my name
Nothing's gonna change
What was

Cold, driving through my neighborhood alone
Going past the house but I'm not home this time
Haven't been in a while
I haven't been, 'cause I'm far away
In another state miles away from us
As you try to fan a dying flame
While ashes turn to dust

I wish I could change my name
I wish I could start again
Fly me to a lonely place
Where you'll never see my face
So you'll never feel the pain of
What was
When you're standing in the rain
Calling out my name
Nothing's gonna change
What was

Let me, start over
The moment that I left you in tears
Is a memory that will haunt me for years
And years, and years, and years, and years

Oh, it still does
Oh, it still does
What was

You need somebody to hold
Where the hell did I go?
