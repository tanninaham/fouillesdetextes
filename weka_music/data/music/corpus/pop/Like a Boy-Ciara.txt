Pull up your pants (just like em)
Take out the trash (just like em)
Gettin your cash like em
Fast like em
Girl, you wanna act like he did (Im talkin bout)
Security codes on everything
On vibrate so your phone dont ever ring (never ring)
Joint account and another one he dont know about (hey)
Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that
Tell you I love you, but when you call, I never get back (oh)
Would you ask them questions like me, like where you be at?
Cause Im out, four in the morning on the corner, rolling, doing my own thing
What if I, had a thing on the side
Made you cry?
Would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy
Cant be getting mad what, you mad?
Cant handle that
Cant be getting mad what, you mad?
Cant handle that
Girl, go ahead and be (just like em)
Go run the streets (just like em)
Go home, missin sleep like em, creep like em
Front wit your friends
Act hard when you wit em, like em
Keep a straight face when you tell a lie
Always keep an airtight alibi
Keep it hid in the dark
What he dont know wont break his heart (hey)

If I was always gone
Let the sun beat me home (would you like that?)
Told you I was with my crew when I knew it wasnt true if I act like you (would you like that?)
Walked a mile up in your shoes (would you like that?)
Messing with your head again
Dose of your own medicine
What if I, had a thing on the side (what if I)
Made you cry? (made you cry)
Would the rules change up or would they still apply?

If I paged you (would you like that?)
Had friends (would you like that?)
Never call (would you like that?)
No, no, you wouldnt like that, no
What if I, made you cry? Would they still apply?
What if I, if I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I did act like a boy
