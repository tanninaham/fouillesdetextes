[Intro: Chilli]
Oh oh

[Verse 1: Chilli]
A scrub is a guy that thinks hes fly
And is also known as a busta
Always talkin bout what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so

[Pre Chorus: Chilli]
No, I dont want your number
No, I dont wanna give you mine and
No, I dont wanna meet you nowhere
No, dont want none of your time and

[Chorus: Chilli & T Boz]
No, I dont want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side of his best friends ride
Trying to holla at me
I dont want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side of his best friends ride
Trying to holla at me

[Verse 2: Chilli]
Well a scrub checkin me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
Cause Im lookin like class and hes lookin like trash
Cant get wit a deadbeat ass, so

[Pre Chorus: Chilli]
No, I dont want your number
No, I dont wanna give you mine and
No, I dont wanna meet you nowhere
No, dont want none of your time

[Chorus: Chilli & T Boz]
No, I dont want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side of his best friends ride
Trying to holla at me
I dont want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side of his best friends ride
Trying to holla at me

[Bridge: Chilli]
If you dont have a car and youre walkin
Oh, yes son, Im talkin to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh, yes son, Im talkin to you (Baby)
If you have a shorty that you dont show love
Oh, yes son, Im talkin to you

No scrub, no, no
No scrub, no, no, no, no
No scrub, no, no
