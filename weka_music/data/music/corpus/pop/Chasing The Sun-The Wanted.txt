Im better, so much better now

I see the light, touch the light, were together now

Im better, so much better now

Look to the skies, gives me life, were together now

Weve only just begun, hypnotized by drums

Until forever comes

Youll find us chasing the sun

They said this day wouldnt come, we refused to run

Weve only just begun

Youll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Youll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Youll find us chasing the sun

And when they say lifes faded (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Were gonna play in the dark til its golden again (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

And now it feels so amazing (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Cant see it coming, I will never grow old again (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Youll find us chasing the sun

Im never, Im never down

Lying here, staring up, and youre looking down

Im never, Im never down

Live forever, forever with you around

Weve only just begun, hypnotized by drums

Until forever comes

Youll find us chasing the sun

They said this day wouldnt come, we refused to run

Weve only just begun

Youll find us chasing the sun

The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun

Youll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Youll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Youll find us chasing the sun

And when they say lifes faded (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Were gonna play in the dark til its golden again (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

And now it feels so amazing (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Cant see it coming, I will never grow old again (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Youll find us chasing the sun

(Chasing the sun)

(Chasing the sun)

(Youll find us chasing the sun)
