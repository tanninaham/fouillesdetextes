Come on, Harry, we wanna say "good night" to you!

 

Holding me back

Gravitys holding me back

I want you to hold out the palm of your hand

Why dont we leave it at that?

Nothing to say

When everything gets in the way

Seems you cannot be replaced

And Im the one who will stay

Oh oh oh

In this world

Its just us

You know its not the same as it was

In this world

Its just us

You know its not the same as it was

As it was

As it was

You know its not the same

Answer the phone

Harry, youre no good alone

Why are you sitting at home on the floor?

What kind of pills are you on?

Ringing the bell

And nobodys coming to help

Your daddy lives by himself

He just wants to know that youre well

Oh oh oh

In this world

Its just us

You know its not the same as it was

In this world

Its just us

You know its not the same as it was

As it was

As it was

You know its not the same

Go home, get ahead, light speed internet

I dont wanna talk about the way that it was

Leave America, two kids follow her

I dont wanna talk about whos doing it first

Hey!

As it was

You know its not the same as it was

As it was

As it was
