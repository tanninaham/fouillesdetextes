I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser

Midnights become my afternoons

When my depression works the graveyard shift

All of the people Ive ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crises

Tale as old as time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day Ill watch as youre leaving

Cause you got tired of my scheming

For the last time

Its me

Hi!

Im the problem, its me

At teatime

Everybody agrees

Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti hero

 

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And Im a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out

Slowly lurching toward your favorite city

Pierced through the heart but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism

I disguise as altruism?

Like some kind of congressman

Tale as old as time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day, Ill watch as youre leaving

And life will lose all its meaning

For the last time

Its me

Hi!

Im the problem, its me (Im the problem, its me)

At teatime

Everybody agrees

Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti hero 

I have this dream my daughter in law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers round and reads it

And then someone screams out

"Shes laughing up at us from hell!"

Its me

Hi!

Im the problem, its me

Its me

Hi!

Im the problem, its me

Its me

Hi!

Everybody agrees

Everybody agrees

Its me

Hi! (Hi!)

Im the problem, its me (Im the problem, its me)

At teatime

Everybody agrees (everybody agrees)

Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti hero
