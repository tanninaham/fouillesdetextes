I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and somethin more
Ooh yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar (ooh)
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin underneath the stars
Ooh yeah, I want it all
Mm, you got me feelin like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like Im
Like my souls on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when youre close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the partys over, then well bring it right back
And well say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when youre close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the partys over, then well bring it right back
Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I cant get enough
You know you could tear me apart (ooh)
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I cant get enough
Mm, you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like Im
Like my souls on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when youre close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the partys over, then well bring it right back
And well say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when youre close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the partys over, then well bring it right back
Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I dont want it to stop
You know you make me shiver er er
Baby, you burn so hot
