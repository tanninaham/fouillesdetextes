Tonights the night, lets live it up
I got my money, lets spend it up (I feel )
Go out and smash it like oh my God
Jump off that sofa, lets kick it off (I feel )
{I know that well have a ball}
{If we get down and go out and just lose it all}
I feel {stressed out, I wanna let it go}
Lets go way out, spaced out, and losin all control

Fill up my cup, mazel tov
Look at her dancin, just take it off (I feel )
Lets paint the town, well shut it down
Lets burn the roof
{And then well do it again} (I feel )
Lets do it, lets do it, lets do it, lets do it
And do it, and do it, {lets live it up}
And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
Lets do it, lets do it, lets do it
