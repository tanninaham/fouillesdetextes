My lovers got humor
Shes the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybodys disapproval
I shouldve worshiped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
Shes the last true mouthpiece
Every Sundays getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
"We were born sick", you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only Heaven Ill be sent to
Is when Im alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
A , Amen, Amen, Amen
Take me to church
Ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
Ill tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
Ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
Ill tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
If Im a pagan of the good times
My lovers the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
Thats a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
Weve a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work
Take me to church
Ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
Ill tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
Ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
Ill tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Oh, oh, Amen, Amen, Amen
Take me to church
Ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
Ill tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
Ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
Ill tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
