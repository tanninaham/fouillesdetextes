Sold me out for chicken change
Said my woman had it all arranged
Tried to make a deal, but she wanted to squeal
But I had my boys on her heels
Saw me coming, told a lie
She broke down and she wanted to cry
I dont care what she does
Wont be doing just like she was
Take those kids and raise them up
Show em how to drink out the righteous cup
Take her, take that woman, its one place she found
Just run that mother out of town
Make her get up, make her get up, get out
Make her get up, make her get up, get out
Im mad, I want revenge, I want revenge, my

My patience ends, I want revenge
My patience ends, I want revenge
I want revenge, I want revenge

I need those hits, hit me!

Lord, I need those hits
Carry on, carry on, payback melody
Alright
(The big payback)
