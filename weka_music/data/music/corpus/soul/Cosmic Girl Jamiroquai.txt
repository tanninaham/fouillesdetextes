I mustve died and gone to heaven

Cause it was quarter past eleven

On a Saturday in 1999

Right across from where Im standing

On the dance floor she was landing

It was clear that she was from another time

Like some baby Barbarella

With the stars as her umbrella

She asked me if Id like to magnetise

Do I have to go star trekking

Cause its you I should be checking

So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes

Shes just a cosmic girl

From another galaxy

My hearts at zero gravity

Shes from a cosmic world

Putting me in ecstasy

Transmitting on my frequency

Shes cosmic

â™ª

Im scanning all my radars

Well she said shes from a quasar

Forty thousand million light years away

Its a distant solar system

Tried to phone but they dont list em

So I asked her for her number all the same

She said, "step in my transporter

So I can teleport ya

All around my heavenly body"

Oh, this could be a close encounter

I should take care not to flounder

Sends me into hyperspace

When I see her pretty face

Shes just a cosmic girl

From another galaxy

My hearts at zero gravity

Shes from a cosmic world

Putting me in ecstasy

Transmitting on my frequency

Shes cosmic

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Shes just a cosmic girl

From another galaxy

Transmitting on her frequency

Yeah cosmic, oh

Cant you be my cosmic woman?

I need you, I want you

To be my cosmic girl, for the rest of time

Oh, Im losing my love

Oh, my cosmic girl yeah

She gives me ecstasy
