Oohooh, I bet youre wondering how I knew
Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Dont you know that

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, Im just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

I know a man aint supposed to cry
But these tears, I cant hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And Im just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
But I cant help being confused
If its true please tell me, dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Dont you know

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh, Im just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey, honey, I know (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)
That youre letting me go (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I heard it through the grapevine (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)
Ooh, heard it through the grapevine (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
