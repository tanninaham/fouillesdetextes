When a man loves a woman
Cant keep his mind on nothin else
Hed change the world for the good thing hes found
If she is bad, he cant see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
Hell spend his very last dime
Tryin to hold on to what he needs
Hed give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said thats the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please dont treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin him for a fool
Hes the last one to know
Lovin eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause baby, baby, youre my world

When a man loves a woman...
