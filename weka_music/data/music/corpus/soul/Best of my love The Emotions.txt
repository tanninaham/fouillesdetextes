Doesnt take much to make me happy

And make me smile with glee

Never never will I feel discouraged

Cause our loves no mystery

Demonstrating love and affection

That you give so openly, yeah

I like the way you make me feel about you, baby

Want the whole wide world to see

Oh oh, youve got the best of my love

Oh oh (oh), youve got the best of my love

Oh oh, youve got the best of my love

Oh oh (oh), youve got the best of my love

Goin in and out of changes

The kind that come around each day

My life has a better meaning

Love has kissed me in a beautiful way

Oh, yeah

(My love, my love)

Oh, oh, oh, yeah

(My love, my love) ooh

Oh oh (yes you do), youve got the best of my love

Oh oh, youve got the best of my love

Oh oh, youve got the best of my love

Demonstrating sweet love and affection

That you give so openly, yeah

The way I feel about you, baby, cant explain it

Want the whole wide world to see

Oh, but in my heart youre all I need

You for me and me for you (my love, my love)

Oh yeah, its growing everyday, baby (my love, my love)
