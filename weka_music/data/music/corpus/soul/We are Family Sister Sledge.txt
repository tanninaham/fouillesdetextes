Get up everybody and sing

Everyone can see were together
As we walk on by
(Fly) and we fly just like birds of a feather
I wont tell no lie

Can they be that close
Just let me state for the record
Were giving love in a family dose

We are family
Get up everybody and sing
(Sing it to me)
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
