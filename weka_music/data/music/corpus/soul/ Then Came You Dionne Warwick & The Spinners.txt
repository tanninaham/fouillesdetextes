Ever since I met you
Seems I cant forget you
The thought of you
Keeps running through the back of my mind
Every time Im near you
I get that urge to feel you
Just touching you
And loving you makes everything right
(Tell me how you feel, baby)

I never knew love before (Oh, no)
Then came you, you
Then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you
Then came you
You

Now that I have found you
How did I live without you
(I dont know, baby)
Its plain to see
Youre all I need to satisfy me
Im so darned proud of you
I wanna sing about you
(Sing it, sing it, sing it, baby)
All I know
You made love grow
By touching my hand
Oh, uh oh
I never knew love be

Then came you (You)
Then came you, ooh
I never knew love before
Then came you (Ooh ooh ooh)
Then came you
Hey, hey, hey, then came you

Whoa, oh uh oh, oh oh
I never knew love before
Then came you
Then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you, you
Then came you
Whoa, oh uh oh, oh oh
I never knew love before
(They told me all about you)
Then came you (Hey, hey)
Then came you, you
I never knew love before, hey
Then came you
(With your loving touch) You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Then came you (Yeah), hey, hey
You know, I never knew love before
(I got to hand it to you, baby)
Then came you, then came you
(Got the power of love)
Then came you
(Got the power of love, baby)
I never knew love before
Then came you
Then came you
(Hey, hey, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I never knew love before
Then came you

No, no, I never knew love before
Then came you
