These are the eyes
That never knew how to smile
Till you came into my life (Do do do do do)
And these are the arms
That long to lock you inside
Every day and every night (Do do do do do)

Girl, and here is the soul
Oh which youve taken control
Cant you see, Im tryin to show love is right

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "I love you" (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby

These are the hands
That cant help reaching for you
If youre anywhere in sight
(Anywhere in sight)
And these are the lips
That cant help calling your name
In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)

Whoa, and here is the man
Who needs to know where you stand
Dont you know Ive done all I can?
So decide

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "I love you" (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way, too
Say you do, say you do, baby, baby, baby

Ahh, and here is the soul
Of which youve taken control
Cant you see, Im tryin to show love is right

Ooh, girl, show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say, "Oh, I love you" (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, say you do, baby

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "Oh, I love you" (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby, baby
