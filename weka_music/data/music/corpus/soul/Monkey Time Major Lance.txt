Theres a place right across town, whenever youre ready
Where people gather round, whenever theyre ready
And then the music begins to play
You feel a groove comin on its way

Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Well, you get yours cause I got mine
For the Monkey Time (Monkey Time)
(Monkey Time)

Now the dance that the people do, I dont know how it started
All I know that when the beat brings a feel
Its hard to get parted
And then the music begins to play
Automatically youre on your way

Are you ready (Are you ready?)
Well, you get yours cause I got mine
For the Monkey Time (Monkey Time)

Ah, do the Monkey, yeah (Do the Monkey Time)
Ah, do the Monkey, yeah (Do the Monkey Time)
And twist them hips (Twist them hips)
Let your backbone slip (Let your backbone slip)
Now move your feet (Move your feet)
Get on the beat (Get on the beat)

Are you ready (Are you ready?)
Well, you get yours cause I got mine
For the Monkey Time (Monkey Time)
(Monkey Time)

Now this dance that the people do, I dont know how it started
All I know that when the beat brings a feel
Its hard to get parted
And then the music begins to play
Automatically youre on your way

Are you ready (Are you ready?)
Well, you get yours cause I got mine
For the Monkey Time (Monkey Time)

Ah, do the Monkey, yeah
Give me a big strong line
Youre looking real fine
