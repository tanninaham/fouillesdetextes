Lets stay together

I, Im so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is alright with me
Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Let me say that since, baby, since weve been together
Ooh, loving you forever is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
Ill never be untrue

Ooh, baby, lets, lets stay together
Lovin you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Ooh, yeah
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why somebody, why people break up
Turn around and make up, I just cant see
Youd never do that to me, would you baby?
Just being around you is all I see, its what I want to do


Lets, we ought to stay together
Lovin you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Cmon, lets, lets stay together
Ill keep on lovin you whether
Whether times are, oh times are good or times are bad
