Your eyes tell me how you want me
I can feel it in your heart beat
I know you like what you see
Hold me, Ill give you all that you need
Wrap your love around me
Youre so excited, I can feel you
Getting hotter, oh baby
Ill take you down, Ill take you down
Where no ones ever gone before
And if you want more
If you want more, more, more
Then jump
For my love
Jump in
And feel my touch
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump (jump) for my love
Jump
I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in
You know these arms can feel you up
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump (jump) for my love
You told me, Im the only woman for you
Nobody does you like I do
Then make a move before you try and go much further
Oh baby

And Heaven waits here at my door
And if you want more
If you want more, more, more
Then jump
For my love
Jump in
And feel my touch
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump (jump) for my love
