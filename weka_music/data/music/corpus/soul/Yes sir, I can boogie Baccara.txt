Mister
Your eyes are full of hesitation
Sure makes me wonder
If you know what your looking for
Umm, baby I wan't to keep my reputation
I'm a sensation
You try me once you'll beg for more
Oooohh! Yes sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie, boogie woogie all night long
Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie woogie all night long
No sir
I don't feel very much like talking
No neither walking
You wanna know if I can dance
Yes sir, already told you in the first verse and in the chorus
But I will give you one more chance
Ooohh! Yes sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie, boogie woogie all night long
Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie woogie all night long
Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie woogie all night long
Yes sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie, boogie woogie all night long
Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie woogie all night long
Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie woogie all night long
Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie woogie all night long
