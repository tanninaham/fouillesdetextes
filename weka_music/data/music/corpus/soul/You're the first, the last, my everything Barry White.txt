We got it together, didn't we?

Nobody, but you and me

We got it together, baby



My first, my last, my everything

And the answer to all my dreams

You're my sun (sun), my moon (moon), my guiding star

My kind of wonderful, that's what you are

I know there's only, only one like you

There's no way, they could have made two

You're all I'm living for

Your love I'll keep for evermore

You're the first, you're the last, my everything



In you I've found so many things

A love so new only you could bring

Can't you see it? You

You'll make me feel this way

You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day

I see so many ways that I can love you

'Til the day I die

You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream

You're the first, (the last) the last, my everything



I know there's only, only one like you

There's no way they could have made two

Girl, you're my reality

But I'm lost in a dream

You're the first, (the last) you're the last, my everything
