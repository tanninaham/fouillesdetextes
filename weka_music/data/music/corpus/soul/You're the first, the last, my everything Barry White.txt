We got it together, didnt we?

Nobody, but you and me

We got it together, baby



My first, my last, my everything

And the answer to all my dreams

Youre my sun (sun), my moon (moon), my guiding star

My kind of wonderful, thats what you are

I know theres only, only one like you

Theres no way, they could have made two

Youre all Im living for

Your love Ill keep for evermore

Youre the first, youre the last, my everything



In you Ive found so many things

A love so new only you could bring

Cant you see it? You

Youll make me feel this way

Youre like a first morning dew on a brand new day

I see so many ways that I can love you

Til the day I die

Youre my reality, yet Im lost in a dream

Youre the first, (the last) the last, my everything



I know theres only, only one like you

Theres no way they could have made two

Girl, youre my reality

But Im lost in a dream

Youre the first, (the last) youre the last, my everything
