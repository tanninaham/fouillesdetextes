I believe in miracles
Wherere you from?
You sexy thing, sexy thing you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along
You sexy thing
Where did you come from, baby?
How did you know I needed you?
How did you know I needed you so badly?
How did you know Id give my heart gladly?
Yesterday I was one of the lonely people
Now youre lying close to me, making love to me
I believe in miracles
Wherere you from?
You sexy thing, sexy thing you

Did you know every night and day for?
Everyday, youd give love and satisfaction
Now youre lying next to me, giving it to me
