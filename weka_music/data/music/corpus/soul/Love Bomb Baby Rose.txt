I was waiting for the right time
Would you come to me?
I was hoping you could stay around
Think of how it could be

Pacing back and forth in my mind
Wonder how you’re feeling
Can we close the gap between us
Can I be what you need
You need

You know that moment
Closer that you get I
Feel it coming
Losing all my sense of time
Can’t control it
Nothing else exists but us

You know that moment
Closer that you get I
Feel it coming
Losing all my grip
Hold tight
Can’t control it
Nothing else exists but us

Feels so right
When it’s only
You and I
Wanted what’s so hard to find
Waiting on this high high high

You know that moment
Closer that you get I
Feel it coming
Losing all my sense of time
Can’t control it
Nothing else exists but us

You know that moment
Closer that you get I
Feel it coming
Losing all my grip
Hold tight
Can’t control it
Nothing else exists but us

You know that moment
Closer that you get I
Feel it coming
Losing all my grip
Hold tight
Can’t control it
Nothing else exists but us
