Ive heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
But
I dont know about that
As many times as weve loved and
Weve shared love and made love, its (Well, well)
It doesnt seem to me like its enough (Ahh, yeah yeah)
Theres just not enough of it
Theres just not enough

Oh oh, babe
Oh babe

My darling, I
Cant get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I dont know, I dont know why
Cant get enough of your love, babe

Oh, some things I cant get used to
No matter how I try
Its like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, thats no lie
Oh no, babe
Tell me
What can I say?
What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that youre givin me?
Is it in your kiss or just because youre sweet?

Girl, all I know
Is every time youre here
I feel the change, huh
Somethin moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin

Darling, I
Cant get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I dont know, I dont know, I dont know why
I cant get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe

Girl, if I could only make you see
And make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand
Oh well, babe
How can I explain all the things I feel?
Youve given me so much
Girl, youre so unreal, still
I keep loving you
More and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do
Because youre blowin my mind

I get the same old feelin
Every time youre here
I feel the change
Somethin moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin

Darling, I
Cant get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe

Baby, it didnt take
All of my life to find you
But you can believe its gonna take the rest of my life
To keep you
Ohh, ohh babe
Ehhhhhhhhhh

My darling, I
Cant get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I dont know, I dont know, I dont know why
Cant get enough of your love, babe

Oh my darling, I
Cant get enough of your love, babe
Oh, babe
Girl, I dont know, I dont know why
