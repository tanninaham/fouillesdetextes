Ive been so many places in my life and time
Ive sung a lot of songs
Ive made some bad rhymes
Ive acted out my life on stages
With ten thousand people watching

But were alone now
And Im singing this song to you

I know your image of me
Is what I hoped to be
I treated you unkindly
But darling, cant you see?
Theres no one more important to me
Baby, cant you see through me?

Cause were alone now
And Im singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets
Of a true love while holding nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now Im so much better
And if my words dont come together
Listen to the melody
Cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place
Where theres no space or time
I love you for my life
Cause you re a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together

We were alone
And I was singing this song to you

I love you in a place
Where theres no space or time
I love you for my life
Cuz you re a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together

We were alone
And I was singing this song to you
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you
We were alone
And I was singing this song
Singing this song to you
