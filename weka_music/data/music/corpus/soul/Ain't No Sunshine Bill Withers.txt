Aint no sunshine when shes gone
Its not warm when shes away
Aint no sunshine when shes gone
And shes always gone too long
Anytime shes goes away
Wonder this time where shes gone
Wonder if shes gone to stay
Aint no sunshine when shes gone
And this house just aint no home
Anytime she goes away
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know
Hey, I ought to leave young thing alone
But aint no sunshine when shes gone, whoa, whoa
Aint no sunshine when shes gone
Only darkness every day
Aint no sunshine when shes gone
And this house just aint no home
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
