Youre giving love instinctively

Round and round youre turning me

Upside down

Boy, you turn me inside out

And, round and round

Upside down

And, round and round

Instinctively you give to me

The love that I need

I cherish the moments with you

Respectfully, I say to thee

Im aware that youre cheating

When no one makes me feel like you do

Upside down

Boy, you turn me inside out

And, round and round
