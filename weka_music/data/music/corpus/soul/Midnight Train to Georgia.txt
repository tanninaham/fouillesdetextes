Mmmm L.A
Proved too much for the man
(Too much for the man he couldnt make it)
So hes leavin the life hes come to know
(He said hes goin)
He said hes goin back to find
(Goin back to find)
Ooh ooh ooh whats left of his world
The world he left behind
Not so long ago

Hes leaving (leavin)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leavin on a midnight train)
Said hes goin back (Goin back to find)
To a simpler place and time
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess whos gonna be right by his side)
Oh yes he is

And Ill be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
Id rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine
(That world is his, his and hers alone)

He kept dreamin (Dreamin)
Ooh that someday hed be a star
(A superstar but he didnt get far)
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams dont always come true
(Dreams dont always come true)
Oh no! ah ah (uh uh, no, uh uh)

So he pawned all his hopes
And he even sold his old car
Bought a one way ticket back
To the life he once knew
Oh yes he did

He said he would
Oh oh hes leavin (leavin)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train )

Said hes goin back to find (Goin back to find)
Oh a simpler place and time
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess whos gonna be right by his side)
Im gonna be with him
(I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
Id rather live in his world (Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(Her world is his, his and hers alone)

Ooh, hes leaving
(Leaving)
On the midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on the midnight train)
Said hes going back to find
(Going back to find)
Ooh, a simpler place and time
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess whos gonna be right by his side)
Ive got to be with him
(I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
Id rather live in his world
(Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(Her world is his, his and hers alone)

For love, gonna board the midnight train to ride
For love, gonna board, gotta board the midnight train to go
For love, gonna board, uh huh, the midnight train to go
My world, his world, our world, mine and his alone
My world, his world, our world, mine and his alone
I got to go
I got to go
I got to go, hey

My world, his world, my man, his girl
I got to go
I got to go, oh

My world, his world, our world, his girl
