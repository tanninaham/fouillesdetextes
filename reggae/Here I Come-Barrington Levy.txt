Eeh-ooh, eeh-ooh, ooh-eeh-ooh

Shoodilley-waddliley-diddley-diddley, whoa-oh

Zeen!

On the intercom, Rosie tell me to come

Say, she didn't have a daughter, she did have a son

She said, "The lift doesn't work, run up the stairs and come

And if you don't come quick, you're not gonna know that son"

So I grabbed a bunch of rose, and I started to run

Here I come (whoa-oh)

Two months later, she said, "Come and get your son

'Cause I don't want your baby to come tie me down

And because you are old, and I am young

Yes, while a me young, yes, I wanna have some fun"

Run me down

Shoodilley-waddliley-diddley-diddley, whoa-oh, swing

I'm broad, I'm broad

I'm broader than Broadway

Yes, I'm broad, I'm broad

I'm broader than Broadway

When you go to Volcano, it's like a stage show

You have men that sing, DJ and blow

Put it on the radio (put it on the radio)

Eeh-oh-eeh-oh-oh, swing

On the intercom, Rosie tell me to come

Say, she didn't have a daughter, she did have a son

She said, "The lift doesn't work, run up the stairs and come

So I grabbed a bunch of roses and I started to run

Here I come (whoa-oh)

Two months later, she said, "Come and get your son

'Cause I don't want your baby to come tie me down

And because you are old, and I am young
