And him never yet complain say, "youre deep"
You make your vow, you know, answer to yow
And a one man a sample your chocho

Me want hear you scream
If your mouth clean
No man never rope you in for no ice cream
You dont smell green
Like Sharlene
You hold a fresh
And have a healthy hygiene
Some assuming, while you keep blooming
Like a pretty little lilly inna di morning
Youre not brawling, pressure dem darling
While youre rising them keep falling
...so sing again

Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
Just make a bwoy know you nah blow
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
No bwoy aint got no secret for you
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
Just make a bwoy know you nah blow
Heads High.. kill dem with the "No!"
Tell them say, "Vegas say so..."
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
Just make a bwoy know you nah blow
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
No bwoy aint got no secret for you
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
Just make a bwoy know you nah blow
Heads High.. kill dem with the "No!"
Tell them say, "Vegas say so..."
(make a boy know you ah no pappy show)

Me want you scream, bruk out, whine up your body
Hand inna the air, cause you a no ray ray
One ship alone can dock pon a bay
Pon a bwoy mic you nah DJ

Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
Just make a bwoy know you nah blow
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
No bwoy aint got no secret for you
