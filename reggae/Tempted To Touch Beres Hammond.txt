Hey little girl each time you passed my way Im tempted to touch
Oooh baby
The dress you wear, your perfume, keeps me wanting you so much
Now I cant help thinking of you
Of all the lonely nights that you put me through

A love like yours will never leave me again behind

Of all the lonely nights that you put me through
