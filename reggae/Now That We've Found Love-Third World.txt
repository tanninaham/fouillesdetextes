Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Make natty shook, make natty shook
Make natty shook, make natty shook
Make natty shook, shook, shook, shook all over the place
I say, come on, baby, when the music's playin'
I wanna see you dance, dance, dance
Come on, baby
Said, when the music's playin'
I wanna see you dance, get up and dance
Move yeah, I said move, yeah
I said come on, baby
Let me show you what a, what a man can do
I said music, whoa, yeah
It's there sewn into my soul
Moving all day long (to the rhythm doop doop doo-doo-day)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
(What are we gonna do tell me, tell me what are we gonna do with love?)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Let's give love a try
Let Jah control, control your destiny
We owe it to ourselves, yes, we do
To live happy, eternally
Sweet love is what we've been searchin' for
And love is what we're lookin' for
Yeah, now that I've got it right here in my hand
I'm gonna spread it all over the land
Now
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
You've got to forgive and forget
Let hate, let hate be your enemy
Bow to the Lord
And only love will set your spirit free
Whoa, love is what we've been searchin' for
And sweet love is what we're lookin' for
Now that I got it right here in my hand
We're gonna share it all over the land
Now that we found love tell me what we gonna do with it?
I really like to know, whoa, tell me now
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
