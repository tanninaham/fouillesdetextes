How's it going dude?

Hey man, what's up?

Tell Todd he can turn the radio back on

When you grab a hold of me

You tell me that I'll never be set free

But I'm a parasite

Creep and crawl, I step into the night

Two pints of booze

Tell me, are you a badfish too?

(Are you a badfish too?)

Ain't got no money to spend

I hope the night would never end

Lord knows I'm weak

Won't somebody get me off of this reef?

Baby you're a big blue whale

Grab the reef when all duck divin' fails

I swim, but I wish I'd never learned

The water's too polluted with germs

I dive deep when it's ten feet overhead

Grab the reef underneath my bed

(Underneath my bed)

Ain't got no quarrels with God

Ain't got no time to grow old

Lord knows I'm weak

Won't somebody get me off of this reef?

I gotta go dude

♪

Ain't got no quarrels with God

Ain't got no time to get old

Lord knows I'm weak

Won't somebody get me off of this reef?
