Red, red wine

Go to my head

Make me forget that I

Still need her so

Red, red wine

It's up to you

All I can do, I've done

Mem'ries won't go

Mem'ries won't go

♪

I'd have sworn

That with time

Thoughts of you would leave my head

I was wrong

Now I find

Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine

Stay close to me

Don't let me be alone

It's tearin' apart

My blue, blue heart
