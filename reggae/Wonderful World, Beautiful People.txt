Hey, yeah, wonderful world, beautiful people

You and your girl, things could be pretty

But underneath this there is a secret

That nobody can repeat

Take a look at the world

And the state that it's in today

I am sure you'll agree

We all could make it a better way

With our love put together

Everybody learn to love each other

Instead of fussing and fighting

Cheating but biting, scandalizing and hating

Baby, we could have a wonderful world, beautiful people

You and your girl, things could be pretty

But underneath this there is a secret

That nobody can repeat, yeah now

Man and woman, girl and boy

Let us try to give a helping hand

This I know and I'm sure

That the love we all could understand

This is our world, can't you see?

Everybody wants to live and be free

Instead of fussing and fighting

Cheating but biting, scandalizing and hating

Yeah, we could have a wonderful world, beautiful people

You and your girl, things could be pretty

But underneath this there is a secret

That nobody can repeat, yeah, yeah, now

Talking 'bout the wonderful world, beautiful people

You and your girl, things could be pretty

Wonderful world, beautiful people

Wonderful world, beautiful people

Wonderful world, beautiful people

Wonderful world
