Ah where, I'll phone ya
And how de international farmer
I've got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
I've got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Don't cut down the cali tree
'Cause it makes the best tea for me
I've seen doctor say, it gives naturally
One thing this doctor will need
A lot of food
To survive and go through, in Babylon
I've got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
I've got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Yes, I've walked the streets and seen children downtown
Begging everyone they see, and it hurt me
It can't be right for what this world do for the youth
And the little herb I'm selling, they want to capture me
I and I don't cherish wickedness
Because it's none profit to I and I
I've got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard, oh
I've the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Anything that is none profit
I and I don't take for it
Pass it, pass it
All over I and I
No need to 'fraid
Looks like a mansion, ah
Life well different
Four little birds
I've got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
I've the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
There is a red house over yonder
Full of marijuana
I've been sitting on the corner
Chatting up with the farmer, oh
Got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
I've the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
Free the herb, free the herb
Heal the nation
Heal the sick
Sell, sell that herb
To be rich
I think what we would want in life
There's some of what is going on
That we don't want a thing in life
To be goin' round like worm, no, no
I'd rather do sin-
Stalk of Sinsemilla
I've got the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
I've the stalk of Sinsemilla
Growing in my backyard
He dreamt that's what they'd mention
For marijuana
