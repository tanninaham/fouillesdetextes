Sweep over my soul, mhm hm
Sweep over my soul
Though the road in life gets rough
Jah Jah, sweep over my soul
Binghi vibe
Sweep over my soul
Sweep over my soul
Though the billows roll and tempest blow
Jah Jah will sweep over my soul (Sweep over my soul)

Everyday every morning
I will sing a song of praise to Him
Hail the king of kings (Hail the king of kings)
Everyday I will rise, every morn I will sing
Every evening I will lift my voice
Lift my voice in praise, higher, higher
Oh Lord

Sweep over my soul
Sweep over my soul
Though the billows roll and tempest blow
Sweep over my soul

I hear a voice is callin from somewhere out there
A voice is singing somewhere in my head
And I know that I must rise, and fill my heart and pray
And sing for Jah Jah all my days
I

I say sweep over my soul, oh
Sweep over my soul
The road may rough and tough and goin gets so hard
Jah, sweep over my soul

Gethsemane, Gethsemane, oh Gethsemane
Oh oh
And I shall lift I voice to the Holy One of creation (Gethsemane)
And I shall sing songs of redemption (Gethsemane)
Songs of praise onto Him (Gethsemane)
I claim in my position (Gethsemane)
In creation in the son of the Almighty Jah (Gethsemane)
Behold in His glory manifesting through I and I, forever (Gethsemane)
Oh Lord

Sweep over my soul
Sweep over my soul
Though billows roll and tempest blow
Jah, sweep over my soul

Oh, if I had 10,000 bars
I would still be singing a song...
Of praise
