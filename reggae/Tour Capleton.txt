Yeah!
I say break up your folly grounds and straighten your crooked ways
Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly
Selassie I liveth every time

After me lef from Jamaica, go a foreign pon tour
Preaching teaching the people fi sure
Answer to Jah when him a knock pon your door
If you ignore you goin perish fi sure

Come back a Jamaica, everything insecure
Rich a get rich and the poor a get poor
Come back come hear say Pan Head skull bore
Come back come hear say Dirtsman skull bore
Hear say, John Pope Paul all come yah pon tour
DJ down yah a rinse out mi what more
Boogerman a plan all fi march and tour
Tour Kingston, and all go tour Portmore
But me know the whole of dem woulda must dead fi sure
And the DJ dem nah teach people no more
A pure clashing and fighting, dem no unite no more
All a tell the gyal dem fi bruk out like a sore

Man a walk pon road and lick down innocent man
Lick down the little pickiney inna di Prom

And respect Selassie as the Almighty one
