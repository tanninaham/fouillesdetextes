Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know
It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon
(How does it feel when you've got no herb?)
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
(If you got no herb you will walk an' talk)
So I lef' my gate and went out for a walk
As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I hear them say
(How do dey sing when you heard dem sing?)
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know
So I stopped to find out what was going on.
(How do you find when you make your stuff?)
For the spirit of Jah, you know he leads me on
(Them all have a leaf at the dreadlocks' camp)
There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing
I could feel the chill as I see and heard them say
(How do dey sing when you heard dem sing?)
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know
It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon
(How does it feel when you've got no herb?)
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
(If you got no herb you will walk an' talk)
So I lef' my gate and went out for a walk
As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I hear them say
(How do dey sing when you heard dem sing?)
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know...
