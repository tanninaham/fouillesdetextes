There's times when I want somethin' more

Someone more like me

There's times when this dress rehearsal seems

Incomplete, but

You see the colors in me like no one else

And behind your dark glasses you're

You're somethin' else

You're really lovely

Underneath it all

You want to love me

Underneath it all

I'm really lucky

Underneath it all

You're really lovely

You know some real bad tricks

And you need some discipline

But lately, you've been tryin' real hard

And givin' me your best, and

You give me the most gorgeous sleep

That I've ever had

And when it's really bad, I guess

It's not that bad

You're really lovely

Underneath it all

You want to love me

Underneath it all

I'm really lucky

Underneath it all

You're really lovely

So many moons that we have seen

Stumblin' back next to me

I've seen right through and underneath

And you make me better

I've seen right through and underneath

And you make me better, better, better

For real

'Cause underneath it all

You are my real Prince Charmin'

Like the heat from the fire

You were always burnin'

Anytime you're around

My body keeps callin'

For your touch

Your kisses and your sweet romancin'

There's another side to you

And it's a human I adore

Aside from your temper

Everything else secure

Oh no, you're good for me baby

Of that, I'm a sure

'Cause over and over again

Me want more

You've used up all your coupons

And all you've got left is me

And somehow I'm full of forgiveness

I guess it's meant to be

You're really lovely

Underneath it all

You want to love me

Underneath it all

I'm really lucky

Underneath it all

You're really lovely

You're really lovely

Underneath it all

You want to love me

Underneath it all

I'm really lucky

Underneath it all

You're really lovely

Mmm, mmm, mmm

Underneath it all

Mmm, mmm, mmm

Underneath it all

Mmm, mmm, mmm

Underneath it all

Mmm, mmm, mmm

Underneath it all
