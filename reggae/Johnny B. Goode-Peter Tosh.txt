Deep down in Jamaica, close to Mandeville

Back up in the woods, on top of a hill

There stood an old hut made of earth and wood

Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode

He never learned to read and write so well

But he could play his guitar like ringin' a bell yell

I said go (go Johnny!)

Johnny be good tonight, yeah

I said go (go Johnny!)

Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack (turutu-turutu)

Sit beneath a tree in the railroad track, yeah (turutu-turutu)

Old engineer in the train sleepin' in the shade (turutu-turutu)

Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made (turutu-turutu)

People passing by would stop and say (turutu-turutu)

"Oh my, oh my, how what the boy can play" (turutu-turutu)

I said go (go Johnny!)

Johnny be good tonight, yeah

Said go, go (go Johnny!)

Johnny B. Goode

â™ª

Mama said, "Son, you gotta be a man" (go, be a man)

You got to be the leader of a reggae band (it's reggae, it's reggae, it's reggae)

People comin' in from miles around (turutu-turutu)

To hear you play until the sun goes down (turutu-turutu)

Boy, someday your name will be in the lights (turutu-turutu)

Sayin', "Johnny! Johnny B. Goode tonight"

I said go (go Johnny)

Johnny be good tonight, yeah

I said go (go Johnny!)

Johnny you better be good

Said go (go Johnny!)

Johnny be good tonight!

Play (go Johnny!)

Johnny B. Goode

I said go, go, go, go (go Johnny!)

Johnny be good tonight

You can hear when we play (go Johnny!) better be good
