Remember it was under the sycamore tree
A boy want mi bow and mi tell him fi flee
I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
The sun stopped shining for me

Again
I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
A boy want mi bow and mi tell him fi flee
I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
The sun stopped shining for me

Well
Remember when we used to row?
You used to drop a hint and mi think you did a gyow
But mi a goodie goodie and mi never no how
Furthermore mi never decide fi bow

Well
A long time your friend dem did a leak
But true mi kick back and mi never want speak
And mi a gyal wha go a mi church every week
So mi nuh make no boy turn me inna freak

So mi sit
Under the sycamore tree
A boy want mi bow and mi tell him fi flee
I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
The sun stopped shining for me

I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
A boy want mi bow and mi tell him fi flee
I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
The sun stopped shining for me

Mi love you but mi still have mi pride
Mi a gal wha give you all di wickedest ride
But mi haffi stay pon the righteous side
Mi nah make no boy make me walk and hide

Call me old fashioned
I know everyting mi like
Mi a gal wi ride pon your big Ninja bike
Run any marathon inna mi sight
But one mic mi chat pon is mi studio mic

Well, it was under the sycamore tree
A boy want mi bow and mi tell him fi flee
I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
The sun stopped shining for me

I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
A boy want mi bow and mi tell him fi flee
I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
The sun stopped shining for me

A food alone go inna wi mouth
Big up di gal dem from Dunkirk and South
How gal fi bow and wha dem a chat bout
All goodie goodie gal from Rockfort

Junglist and Rema gal dem run the route
Seaview and Kingston 13 a shout
Around, around, around three mile roundabout
Make mi see di hand and without a doubt

Mi say it was under the sycamore tree
A boy want mi bow and mi tell him fi flee
I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
The sun stopped shining for me

Mi say it was under the sycamore tree
A boy want mi bow and mi tell him fi flee
I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
The sun stopped shining for me

Remember when we used to row?
You used to drop a hint and me think you need a go
But mi a goodie goodie and mi never no how
And furthermore mi never decide fi bow

A long time your friend dem did a leak
But true me kick back and mi never want speak
And mi a gyal wha go a mi church every week
So mi nuh make no boy turn me inna freak

I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
A boy want mi bow and mi tell him fi flee
I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
The sun stopped shining for me

Remember, it was under the sycamore tree
A boy want mi bow and mi tell him fi flee
I tell you it was under the sycamore tree
The sun stopped shining for me
