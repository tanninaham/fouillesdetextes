Look here

Persecution you must bear

Win or lose you've got to get your share

Got your mind set on a dream

You can get it, though harder they seem now

You can get it if you really want

You can get it if you really want

You can get it if you really want

But you must try, try and try

Try and try, you'll succeed at last

I know it, listen

Rome was not built in a day

Opposition will come your way

But the hotter the battle you see

It's the sweeter the victory, now

You can get it if you really want

You can get it if you really want

You can get it if you really want

But you must try, try and try

Try and try, you'll succeed at last

(You can get it if you really want) I know it

(You can get it if you really want) so don't give up now

(You can get it if you really want) but keep on trying
