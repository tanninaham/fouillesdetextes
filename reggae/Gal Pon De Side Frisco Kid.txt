Hey, you see di gyal dem....

Big up mi hotti hotti gal, cause a she jook the best
Jah know, mi love the sumn weh da gal yah possess
Right yah now, things a manifest
And mi wife out fi lef
And, fi tell you the truth, mi nuh press
Cause!
Mi girl pon the side jook the best
All when she ready fi go love and caress
And she have the bumper and the chest
Some other gal a vex
Right yah now, a she mi have inna mi nest

Mi baby mother friend dem a blow like a storm
Cause mi little hotti hotti frenny dem a gwan
Dem tell her how mi regular round a Bay Farm
Dem sure say a me, cause dem know mi car horn
She tell me say how, she hear say a me a jook Dawn
And me all buy Chiney Brush round a Tom
The other day we catch up and she tell me shes gone
Big and serious, me tell her fi gwan
Cause, when di hotti hotti dem come fi swarm
Cyan keep mi peace, and me cyan keep mi calm
Di little hotti hotti dem know how fi perform
Dem know wha fi do when dem waan turn me on

Thats why a just mi girl pon the side jook the best
Jah know, mi love the sumn weh da gal deh possess
Right yah now, things a manifest
And mi wife out fi lef
And, fi tell you the truth, mi nuh press

All when she ready fi go love and caress
And she have the bumper and the chest
Some other gal a vex

Most married man have a next gal dating
When me and mi little hot gal dem mating
One bag of pattern and style creating
When me and mi hotti hotti inna bathroom

A nuff time mi dream way and float go a moon
Mi swear pon mi grandfather tomb

Say, a just mi girl pon the side jook the best
Jah know, mi love the sumn weh da gal yah possess
Right yah now, things a manifest
Cause mi wife out fi lef
And, fi tell you the truth, mi nuh press
Cause!

The other day we catch up and she tell me shes gone
Big and serious, me tell her fi gwan
Cause, when di hotti hotti dem come fi swarm...
