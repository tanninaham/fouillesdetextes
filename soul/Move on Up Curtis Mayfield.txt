Hush now, child
And dont cry
Your folks might understand you
By and by
Just move on up
Toward your destination
Though you may find
From time to time, complication
Bite your lip
And take the trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip
Just move on up
For peace youll find
Into the steeple of beautiful people
Where theres only one kind
So hush now, child
And dont you cry
Your folks might understand you
By and by
Move on up
And keep on wishing
Remember your dream is your only scheme
So keep on pushin
Take nothing less
Than the supreme best
Do not obey rumors people say
So you can pass the test
Just move on up
To a greater day
With just a little faith
You can put your mind to it
You can surely do it
