I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories

Hey, window pane
Do you remember
How sweet it used to be?
When we was together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's just one sound
That I just can't stand

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
'Cause he's not here with me

Woah, empty pillow where his head used to lay
I know you've got some sweet memory
But like the window, you ain't got nothin' to say

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Just keeps on haunting me
Hey rain
Get off my window
'Cause he's not here with me
