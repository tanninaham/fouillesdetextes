I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories

Hey, window pane
Do you remember
How sweet it used to be?
When we was together
Everything was so grand
Now that weve parted
Theres just one sound
That I just cant stand

I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Cause hes not here with me

Woah, empty pillow where his head used to lay
I know youve got some sweet memory
But like the window, you aint got nothin to say

I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Just keeps on haunting me
Hey rain
Get off my window
Cause hes not here with me
