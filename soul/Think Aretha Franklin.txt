You better think (think)

Think about what you're tryin' to do to me, think (think-think)

Let your mind go, let yourself be free

Let's go back, let's go back, let's go way on to way back when

I didn't even know you, you couldn't been too much more than ten (just a child)

I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degrees

But it don't take too much IQ to see what you're doing to me

You better think (think)

Think about what you're tryin' to do to me, yeah, think (think-think)

Let your mind go, let yourself be free

'Cause freedom (freedom)

Stands for freedom (freedom)

Oh, freedom

Yeah, freedom!

Right now, freedom (freedom)

Oh-oh, freedom (freedom)

Give me some freedom

Oh, freedom! Oh-oh, right now...

Hey! Think about it

You! Think about it

There ain't nothin' you could ask

I could answer you with "I won't" (I won't)

But I was gonna change, but I'm not

If you keep doin' things I don't (don't)

You better think (think)

Think about what you're tryin' to do to me

(What you're tryin' to do to me) oh-oh, think (think)

Let your mind go, let yourself be free

People walk around everyday playin' games and takin' scores

Tryin' to make other people lose their mind, well, be careful you don't lose yours

Oh, think (think), think about what you're tryin' to do to me

Woo-hoo, think (think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

You need me (need me)

And I need you (don't ya' know?)

Without each other

There ain't nothin' either can do

Oh, yeah, think about it, baby (what ya tryin' to do to me, think)

When I'm gone, baby, think about it right now

Yeah, right now (think about - forgiveness)

Woo, right now (think about - forgiveness)

Hey, right now (think about - forgiveness)

Please think about it (think about it)

Please baby, baby (think about it - forgiveness)

Woo, think about it, baby (think about - forgiveness)

Yeah, woo, think about it, baby (think about - forgiveness)

Please think about it
