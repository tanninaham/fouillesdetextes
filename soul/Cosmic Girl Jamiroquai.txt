I must've died and gone to heaven

'Cause it was quarter past eleven

On a Saturday in 1999

Right across from where I'm standing

On the dance floor she was landing

It was clear that she was from another time

Like some baby Barbarella

With the stars as her umbrella

She asked me if I'd like to magnetise

Do I have to go star-trekking

'Cause it's you I should be checking

So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes

She's just a cosmic girl

From another galaxy

My heart's at zero gravity

She's from a cosmic world

Putting me in ecstasy

Transmitting on my frequency

She's cosmic

â™ª

I'm scanning all my radars

Well she said she's from a quasar

Forty thousand million light years away

It's a distant solar system

Tried to phone but they don't list 'em

So I asked her for her number all the same

She said, "step in my transporter

So I can teleport ya

All around my heavenly body"

Oh, this could be a close encounter

I should take care not to flounder

Sends me into hyperspace

When I see her pretty face

She's just a cosmic girl

From another galaxy

My heart's at zero gravity

She's from a cosmic world

Putting me in ecstasy

Transmitting on my frequency

She's cosmic

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

She's just a cosmic girl

From another galaxy

Transmitting on her frequency

Yeah cosmic, oh

Can't you be my cosmic woman?

I need you, I want you

To be my cosmic girl, for the rest of time

Oh, I'm losing my love

Oh, my cosmic girl yeah

She gives me ecstasy
