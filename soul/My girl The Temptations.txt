Ive got sunshine on a cloudy day
When its cold outside
Ive got the month of May
I guess youd say
What can make me feel this way
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin bout my girl
My girl
Ive got so much honey
The bees envy me
Ive got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess youd say
What can make me feel this way
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin bout my girl
My girl
Ohh ohh
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Oh yeah
I dont need no money, fortune, or fame
Ive got all the riches baby one man can claim
Well I guess youd say
What can make me feel this way
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin bout my girl, my girl, talkin bout my girl
Ive got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
Ive even got the month of May with my girl
Talkin bout, talkin bout, talkin bout
