Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
Im a womans man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
Ive been kicked around since I was born
And now its alright, its okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times effect on man
Whether youre a brother or whether youre a mother
Youre stayin alive, stayin alive
Feel the city breakin and everybody shakin
And were stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin alive
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I cant get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
Im a dancing man and I just cant lose
You know its alright, its okay
Ill live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Times effect on man
Whether youre a brother or whether youre a mother
Youre stayin alive, stayin alive
Feel the city breakin and everybody shakin
And were stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin alive
Life goin nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
Im stayin alive
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
Im a womans man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
Ive been kicked around since I was born
And now its all right, its okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times effect on man
Whether youre a brother or whether youre a mother
Youre stayin alive, stayin alive
Feel the city breakin and everybody shakin
And were stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin alive
Life goin nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
