Whos that lady (whos that lady)
Beautiful lady (whos that lady)
Lovely lady (whos that lady)
Real fine lady (whos that lady)

Hear me calling out to you
Cause thats all that I can do
Your eyes tell me to pursue
But you say "Look yeah, but dont touch, baby"
Nah, nah, nah dont touch

Whos that lady (whos that lady)
Sexy lady (whos that lady)
Beautiful lady (whos that lady)
Real fine lady (whos that lady)

I would dance upon a string
Any gift shed want, Id bring
I would give her anything
If she would just do what I say
Come round my way, baby
Shine my way

Whos that lady (whos that lady)
Beautiful lady (whos that lady)
Lovely lady (whos that lady)
Real real fine lady (whos that lady)

I would love to take her home
But her heart is made of stone
Gotta keep on keepin on
If I dont shell do me wrong
Do me wrong, yeah
