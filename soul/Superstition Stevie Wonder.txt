Very superstitious writings on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders 'bout to fall
Thirteen-month-old baby, broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then we suffer
Superstition ain't the way
Very superstitious, wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problems, do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream, keep me going strong
You don't want to save me, sad is my song
When you believe in things you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeah, yeah
Very superstitious, nothing more to say
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way
Thirteen-month-old baby, broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, no, no, no
