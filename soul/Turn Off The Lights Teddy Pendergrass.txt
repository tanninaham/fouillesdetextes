Turn off the lights and light a candle
Tonight I'm in a romantic mood, yeah
Let's take a shower, said a shower together, yes
I'll wash your body and you'll wash mine, yeah
Rub me down in some, some hot oils, baby
And I'll do the same thing to you

Just turn off the lights, come to me
Girl, I wanna give you a special treat, you're so sweet
Turn off the lights, let's get cozy
See, you're the only one in the world that I need

I wanna love you, love you all over, yeah
Over and over and over and over and over again
Whisper sweet words of, of love in your ear
Show you I how much I missed you, missed you, my dear

You see tonight I'm in, a sexy mood, mood, baby
And light a candle

Would you mind if I asked you to?
Would you rub me down
Would you rub me down in some, in some burnin' hot oils, baby

The same thing to you, baby

Turn 'em off and let's get cozy
Girl, I wanna give you a special treat, you're so sweet
Turn 'em off, come closer
