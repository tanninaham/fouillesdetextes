Doesn't take much to make me happy

And make me smile with glee

Never never will I feel discouraged

'Cause our love's no mystery

Demonstrating love and affection

That you give so openly, yeah

I like the way you make me feel about you, baby

Want the whole wide world to see

Oh oh, you've got the best of my love

Oh oh (oh), you've got the best of my love

Oh oh, you've got the best of my love

Oh oh (oh), you've got the best of my love

Goin' in and out of changes

The kind that come around each day

My life has a better meaning

Love has kissed me in a beautiful way

Oh, yeah

(My love, my love)

Oh, oh, oh, yeah

(My love, my love) ooh

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Oh, got the best of my love

Oh oh (yes you do), you've got the best of my love

Oh oh, you've got the best of my love

Oh oh, you've got the best of my love

Demonstrating sweet love and affection

That you give so openly, yeah

The way I feel about you, baby, can't explain it

Want the whole wide world to see

Oh, but in my heart you're all I need

You for me and me for you (my love, my love)

Oh yeah, it's growing everyday, baby (my love, my love)



Oh oh oh oh oh oh, you've got the best of my love

Oh oh oh oh oh oh, you've got the best of my love

Oh, giving you the best of my love

My love (my love), my love (my love)

Oh, giving you the best of my love

My love (my love), oh yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh oh, you've got the best of my love

Oh oh oh oh oh oh, you've got the best of my love

Oh, giving you the best of my love

(You've got the best, you've got the best)

(You've got the best, you've got the best love)

Oh, giving you the best of my love
