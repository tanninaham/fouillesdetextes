Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're goin' for those pleasures in the night
I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you
And we shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
And we'll have a good time, baby, don't you worry
And if we're still playin' around, boy, that's just fine
Let's get excited, we just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you, I want you
Oh yes I do
Oh boy, I want to love you, feel you
Honey wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
No I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you, I want you
Look what you do to me
You got me burning up (Burning up)
How did you get to me?
I've got to give it up
And I'm so excited (Look what you do to me)
Oh boy (You got me burning up)
I'm burning up yeah, oh I think I like it (Yeah)
You, you, you, you, you got me (I've got to give it up)
(Oh oh oh oh) Oh, ooh I like it boy
And I'm so excited (Look what you do to me)
And I just can't hide it (You got me burning up)
