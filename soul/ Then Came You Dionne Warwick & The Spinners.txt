Ever since I met you
Seems I can't forget you
The thought of you
Keeps running through the back of my mind
Every time I'm near you
I get that urge to feel you
Just touching you
And loving you makes everything right
(Tell me how you feel, baby)

I never knew love before (Oh, no)
Then came you, you
Then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you
Then came you
You

Now that I have found you
How did I live without you
(I don't know, baby)
It's plain to see
You're all I need to satisfy me
I'm so darned proud of you
I wanna sing about you
(Sing it, sing it, sing it, baby)
All I know
You made love grow
By touching my hand
Oh, uh-oh
I never knew love be

Then came you (You)
Then came you, ooh
I never knew love before
Then came you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Then came you
Hey, hey, hey, then came you

Whoa, oh-uh-oh, oh-oh
I never knew love before
Then came you
Then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you, you
Then came you
Whoa, oh-uh-oh, oh-oh
I never knew love before
(They told me all about you)
Then came you (Hey, hey)
Then came you, you
I never knew love before, hey
Then came you
(With your loving touch) You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Then came you (Yeah), hey, hey
You know, I never knew love before
(I got to hand it to you, baby)
Then came you, then came you
(Got the power of love)
Then came you
(Got the power of love, baby)
I never knew love before
Then came you
Then came you
(Hey, hey, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I never knew love before
Then came you
Then came you
(I got to love you, honey)
I never knew love before
(I'm a contented man)
Then came you
(You're sweeter, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter)
Then came you
(Hey, hey, baby)
No, no, I never knew love before
Then came you
Then came you
