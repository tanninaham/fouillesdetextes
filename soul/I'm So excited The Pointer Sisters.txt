Tonights the night were gonna make it happen
Tonight well put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
Were goin for those pleasures in the night
I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just cant get enough
And if you move real slow, Ill let it go
Im so excited, and I just cant hide it
Im about to lose control and I think I like it
Im so excited, and I just cant hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you
And we shouldnt even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
And well have a good time, baby, dont you worry
And if were still playin around, boy, thats just fine
Lets get excited, we just cant hide it
Im about to lose control and I think I like it
Im so excited and I just cant hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you, I want you
Oh yes I do
Oh boy, I want to love you, feel you
Honey wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
No I just cant get enough
And if you move real slow, Ill let it go
Im so excited, and I just cant hide it
Im about to lose control and I think I like it
Im so excited, and I just cant hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you, I want you
Look what you do to me
You got me burning up (Burning up)
How did you get to me?
Ive got to give it up
And Im so excited (Look what you do to me)

You, you, you, you, you got me (Ive got to give it up)
(Oh oh oh oh) Oh, ooh I like it boy
And Im so excited (Look what you do to me)
And I just cant hide it (You got me burning up)
