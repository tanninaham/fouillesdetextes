Have I told you lately that I love you?
If I didnt, darlin, Im sorry
Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms
Oh, when you needed me?
Now I realize that you need love too
Ill spend my life making up to you

Oh, I forgot to be your lover
And Im sorry, baby

Have I taken the time to share with you
All the burdens that lovell bare?
Have I done the little simple things to show you
Just how much I care?
Oh, Ive been workin for you doin all I can
And work all the time didnt make me a man

Oh, I forgot to be your lover
And Im sorry, Ill make it up to you somehow

Said Im sorry, baby, oh yes I am
Said Im sorry, baby, oh yes I am
Girl, I forgot to be your lover, yes I did
Oh, Im sorry, baby
I want you to hold on just a little bit longer
Girl, you gotta hold on just a little bit tighter
If you hold on Im gonna hold on too
And together, baby, theres isnt nothing we cant do
Hold on [?]
Oh that I Im sorry, baby
Oh I forgot to be your lover, yes I did
Im only a man and I forgot
Oh I forgot to be your lover, yes I did
Hold on a little bit longer, just a little bit tighter
