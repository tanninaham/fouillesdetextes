Have I told you lately that I love you?
If I didn't, darlin', I'm sorry
Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms
Oh, when you needed me?
Now I realize that you need love too
I'll spend my life making up to you

Oh, I forgot to be your lover
And I'm sorry, baby

Have I taken the time to share with you
All the burdens that love'll bare?
Have I done the little simple things to show you
Just how much I care?
Oh, I've been workin' for you doin' all I can
And work all the time didn't make me a man

Oh, I forgot to be your lover
And I'm sorry, I'll make it up to you somehow

Said I'm sorry, baby, oh yes I am
Said I'm sorry, baby, oh yes I am
Girl, I forgot to be your lover, yes I did
Oh, I'm sorry, baby
I want you to hold on just a little bit longer
Girl, you gotta hold on just a little bit tighter
If you hold on I'm gonna hold on too
And together, baby, there's isn't nothing we can't do
Hold on [?]
Oh that I I'm sorry, baby
Oh I forgot to be your lover, yes I did
I'm only a man and I forgot
Oh I forgot to be your lover, yes I did
Hold on a little bit longer, just a little bit tighter
