Good times, these are the good times

Leave your cares behind, these are the good times

Good times, these are the good times

Our new state of mind, these are the good times

Happy days are here again

The time is right for makin friends

Lets get together, how bout a quarter to ten

Come tomorrow, lets all do it again

Boys will be boys, better let them have their toys

Girls will be girls, cute pony tails and curls

Must put an end to this stress and strife

I think I want to live the sporting life

Good times, these are the good times

Leave your cares behind, these are the good times

Good times, these are the good times

Our new state of mind, these are the good times

A rumor has it that its getting late

Time marches on, just cant wait

The clock keeps turning, why hesitate

You silly fool, you cant change your fate

Lets cut the rug, little jive and jitterbug

We want the best, we wont settle for less

Dont be a drag, participate

Clams on the half shell and roller skates, roller skates

Good times, these are the good times

Leave your cares behind, these are the good times

Good times, these are the good times

Our new state of mind, these are the good times

A rumor has it that its getting late

Time marches on, just cant wait

The clock keeps turning, why hesitate

You silly fool, you cant change your fate

Lets cut the rug, little jive and jitterbug

We want the best, we wont settle for less

Dont be a drag, participate

Clams on the half shell and roller skates, roller skates

Good times, these are the good times

Leave your cares behind, these are the good times

Good times, these are the good times

Our new state of mind, these are the good times

Good times, these are the good times

Leave your cares behind, these are the good times

Good times, these are the good times

Our new state of mind, these are the good times

Good times, these are the good times

Leave your cares behind, these are the good times

Good times, these are the good times

Our new state of mind, these are the good times
