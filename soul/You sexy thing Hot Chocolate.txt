I believe in miracles
Where're you from?
You sexy thing, sexy thing you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along
You sexy thing
Where did you come from, baby?
How did you know I needed you?
How did you know I needed you so badly?
How did you know I'd give my heart gladly?
Yesterday I was one of the lonely people
Now you're lying close to me, making love to me
I believe in miracles
Where're you from?
You sexy thing, sexy thing you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along
You sexy thing
Where did you come from, angel?
How did you know I'd be the one?
Did you know you're everything I prayed for?
Did you know every night and day for?
Everyday, you'd give love and satisfaction
Now you're lying next to me, giving it to me
I believe in miracles
Where're you from?
You sexy thing, sexy thing you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along
You sexy thing, aaah
Kiss me
You sexy thing
Touch me baby
You sexy thing
I love the way you touch me, darling
You sexy thing
It's ecstasy
You sexy thing
Yesterday, I was one of the lonely people
Now you're lying close to me, giving it to me
I believe in miracles
Where're you from?
You sexy thing, sexy thing you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along
You sexy thing, aaah
Touch me
Kiss me darling
I love the way you hold me, baby
Aaah
It's ecstasy
Aaah
It's ecstasy
Kiss me, baby
I love the way you kiss me, darling
Aaah, yeah
Love the way you hold me
Keep on loving me, darling
Keep on loving me, baby
