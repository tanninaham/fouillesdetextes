(Hurry, hurry, step right up)
(See the saddest show in town for only fifty cents)

Step right up, hurry, hurry
Before the show begins, my friends
Stand in line, get your tickets
I hope you will attend
Itll only cost you fifty cents to see
What life has done to those like you and me

See the man with the broken heart
Youll see that he is sad
He hurts so bad (So bad, so bad)
See the girl who has lost
The only love she ever had
Theres got to be no sadder show to see
No doubt about it, satisfactions guaranteed

So let the sideshow begin
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Cant afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry
Let the sideshow begin, hurry, hurry
(Hurry, hurry, step right on in)
Cant afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

See the man whos been cryin
For a million years
So many tears (So many tears)
See the girl whos collected
Broken hearts for souvenirs
Its more exciting than a one man band
The saddest little show in all the land

So let the sideshow begin, hurry, hurry
(Hurry, hurry, step right on in)
Cant afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry
Let the sideshow begin
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Cant afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

(So let the sideshow begin) Hurry, hurry
(Hurry, hurry, step right on in)
Cant afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry
(Let the sideshow begin) Step right on in
(Hurry, hurry, step right on in)
Cant afford to pass it by
(Guaranteed to make you cry) Hurry, hurry
(Let the sideshow begin)...
