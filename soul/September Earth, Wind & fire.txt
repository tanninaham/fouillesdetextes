Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancing in September
Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
Ba-du-du, ba-du-du, ba-du-du, ba-du-du
Ba-du-du, ba-du-du, ba-du-du, ba-du-du
Ba-du-du, ba-du-du, ba-du-da
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love, remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December, found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember
The true love we share today
Hey, hey, hey
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancing in September
Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
There was a
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancing in September
Ba-dee-ya, golden dreams were shiny days
The bell was ringing, oh, oh
Our souls were singing
Do you remember
Never a cloudy day, yow
There was a
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancing in September
Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
And we'll say
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancing in September
Ba-dee-ya, golden dreams were shiny days
Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
