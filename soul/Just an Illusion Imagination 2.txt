Illusion, illusion


Searching for a destiny that's mine

There's another place, another time

Touching many hearts along the way, yeah

Hoping that I'll never have to say

It's just an illusion (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)

Illusion (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)

Illusion

Follow your emotions anywhere

Is it building magic in the air?

Never let your feelings get you down

Open up your eyes and look around

It's just an illusion (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)

Illusion (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)

Illusion

Could it be that... it's just an illusion?

Putting me back in all this confusion?

Could it be that. it's just an illusion, now?

Could it be that... it's just an illusion?

Putting me back in all this confusion?

Could it be that. it's just an illusion, now?

Could it be a picture in my mind?

Never sure exactly what I'll find

Only in my dreams I turn you on

Here for just a moment then you're gone

It's just an illusion (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)

Illusion (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)

Illusion


(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah) Illusion

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah) Illusion

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah) Illusion
