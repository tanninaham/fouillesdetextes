If you see me walkin' down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by
Walk on by

Make believe that you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry

Walk on by (don't stop)
Walk on by (don't stop)
Walk on by

I just can't get over losin' you
And so if I seem, broken and blue
Walk on by
Walk on by

Foolish pride, that's all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye

Walk on by (don't stop)
Walk on by (don't stop)
Walk on by (don't stop)
Walk on

Walk on by, walk on by

Foolish pride, that's all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye


Walk on by (don't stop)
Walk on by (don't stop)


Now you really gotta go, so walk on by (don't, don't stop)
Baby, leave, you'll never see the tears I cry (don't, don't stop)
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by (don't, don't stop)
Baby, leave, you'll never see the tears I cry (don't, don't stop)
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by (don't, don't stop)
Baby, leave, you'll never see the tears I cry (don't, don't stop)
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by (don't, don't stop)
