Whenever I hear goodbyes

Reminds me baby of you

I break down and cry

The next time I'll be true, yeah

Fever for lost romance

Reminds me baby of you

I took a crazy chance

The next time I'll be true

I'll be true, I'll be true

Footsteps on the dance floor

Reminds me baby of you

Teardrops in my eyes

Next time I'll be true, yeah

Whispers in the powder room

She cries on every tune

Every tune, every tune

And the music

Don't feel like it did

When I felt it with you

Nothing that I do or feel

Ever feels like I felt it with you

When I'm dancing 'round

Reminds me baby of you

I really let you down

Next time I'll be true, yeah

I took a crazy chance

She cries on every tune

Every tune, every tune

Footsteps on the dance floor

Reminds me baby of you

Teardrops in my eyes

Next time I'll be true, yeah

Whispers in the powder room

She cries on every tune

Every tune, every tune

And the music

Don't feel like it did

When I felt it with you

Nothing that I do or feel

Ever feels like I felt it with you

Hurting deep inside

She cries on every tune

I break down and cry

She cries on every tune

Every tune, every tune

Footsteps on the dance floor

Reminds me baby of you

Teardrops in my eyes

Next time I'll be true, yeah

Whispers in the powder room

She cries on every tune

Every tune, every tune

And the music don't feel

Like it did when I felt it with you

No, no, nothing that I do or feel

Ever feels like I felt it with you no, no

And the music don't feel

Like it did when I felt it with you

Nothing that I do or feel

Ever feels like I felt it with you

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Fever for lost romance

I took a crazy chance

Lovers holding hands

Reminds me baby of you

Next time I'll be true
