Its a family affair
Its a family affair
Its a family affair
Its a family affair

One child grows up to be
Somebody that just loves to learn
And another child grows up to be
Somebody youd just love to burn

Mom loves the both of them
You see, its in the blood
Both kids are good to mom
Bloods thicker than the mud

Its a family affair
Its a family affair
Its a family affair
Its a family affair
Over there, world gone bad

Newlywed a year ago
But youre still checking each other out, hey
Nobody wants to blow
Nobody wants to be left out, uh huh

You cant leave cause your heart is there
But, sure, you cant stay cause you been somewhere else
You cant cry cause youll look broke down
But youre cryin anyway cause youre all broke down

Its a family affair
Its a family affair
Its a family affair
Its a family affair
Oh, hey, a family affair
Its a family affair
Its a family affair

Its a family affair
Its a family affair
Its a family affair
(Its a family affair) Its a family affair
Well

Its a family affair
Its a family affair
