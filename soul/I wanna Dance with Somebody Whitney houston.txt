Huh, yeah, woo!
Hey yeah, huh
Ooh yeah, uh huh, yeah
I wanna dance
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
Ive done alright up til now
Its the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
The loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Ive been in love and lost to my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man wholl take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
Somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in his arms, oh
I need a man wholl take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Ooh, ooh (dance)
You know, baby (dance)
Woo! Yeah (dance)
Now get with this
Whoa
Dont you wanna dance (dance) with me, baby?
Dont you wanna dance (dance) with me, boy?

With somebody who loves me
