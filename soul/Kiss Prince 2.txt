Uh!
You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on
I just need your body, baby, from dusk 'til dawn
You don't need experience to turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
Ah, I'm gonna show you what it's all about
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your...
Kiss
Ah, uh-huh
You gotta not talk dirty, baby
Mm, and if you wanna impress me (uh-ah-ah)
You can't be too flirty, mama, I know how to undress me
Yeah, I want to be your fantasy, maybe you could be mine?
You just leave it all up to me we could have a good time
Uh, you don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your...
Kiss
Yes, ah-ah-ah-ah-oh-ah
Ah, I think I wanna dance
Uh!
Woo!
Gotta, gotta, oh
Little girl Wendy's parade
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Women not girls rule my world I said, "They rule my world"
Act your age, mama (not your shoe size), not your shoe size
Maybe we can do the twirl?
You don't have to watch Dynasty to have an attitude
Uh, you just leave it all up to me, my love will be your food
Yeah, you don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your...
Kiss
