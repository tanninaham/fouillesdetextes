I ain't gon' do you wrong while you're gone
Ain't gon' do you wrong 'cause I don't wanna
All I'm askin' is for a little respect when you come home
(Just a little bit) baby
(Just a little bit) when you get home
(Just a little bit) yeah

I'm about to give you all of my money
And all I'm askin' in return, honey
Is to give me my propers when you get home
(Just a, just a, just a, just a) yeah, baby
(Just a, just a, just a, just a) when you get home
(Just a little bit) yeah

Ooh, your kisses, sweeter than honey
And guess what? So is my money
All I want you to do for me, is give it to me when you get home
