Hee hee hee hee!
My babys always dancing and it wouldnt be a bad thing
But I dont get no loving and thats no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye
Dont blame it on the sunshine
Dont blame it on the moonlight
Dont blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Dont blame it on the sunshine
Dont blame it on the moonlight
Dont blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
Ive changed my life completely, Ive seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just cant take her eyes off me
Dont blame it on the sunshine
Dont blame it on the moonlight
Dont blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie (woo)
Dont you blame it on the sunshine
Dont blame it on the moonlight
Dont blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
I just cant, I just cant
I just cant control my feet
I just cant, I just cant (yeah)
I just cant (woo) control my feet
I just cant, I just cant
I just cant control my feet
I just cant, I just cant
I just cant control my feet
Sunshine
Dont blame it on the moonlight
Dont blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Dont blame it on the sunshine
Dont blame it on the moonlight
Dont   on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me
The devils gotten to me through this dance
Im full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
Boogies got me in a super trance
Dont blame it on the sunshine
Dont blame it on the moonlight
Dont blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Dont you blame it   sunshine
Dont blame it on the moonlight
Dont blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Ow! (Sunshine)
Hoo! (Moonlight)
Yeah (good times)
Mmm (boogie)
You just gotta (sunshine)
Yeah (moonlight)
(Good times)
Good times (boogie)
Dont you blame it (sunshine)
You just gotta (moonlight)
You just wanna (good times)
Yeah, oh (boogie)
Blame it on yourself (sunshine)
Aint nobodys fault (moonlight)
But yours and that boogie (good times)
All night long (boogie)
Cant stop that boogie (sunshine)
Aint nobodys fault (moonlight)
But yours and that boogie (good times)
Dancing all night long (boogie)
Blame it on yourself (sunshine)
Aint nobodys fault (moonlight)
But yours and that boogie (good times)
Boogie, boogie, boogie...
