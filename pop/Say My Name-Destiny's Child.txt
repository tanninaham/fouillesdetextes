Say my name, say my name

If no one is around you, say, "Baby I love you"

If you ain't runnin' game

Say my name, say my name

You acting kind of shady, ain't callin' me baby

Why the sudden change?

Say my name, say my name

If no one is around you, say, "Baby I love you"

If you ain't runnin' game

Say my name, say my name

You acting kind of shady, ain't callin' me baby

Betta say my name

Any other day I would call, you would say

"Baby how's your day?" But today it ain't the same

Every other word is "Uh-huh", "Yeah okay"

Could it be that you are at the crib wit another lady?

If you took it there, first of all let me say

I am not the one to sit around and be played

So prove yourself to me, that I'm the girl that you cravin'

Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

I know you sayin' that I'm assuming things

Something's goin' down that's the way it seems

Shouldn't be no reason, why you're acting strange?

Nobody's holding you back from me

'Cause I know how you usually do

When you sayin' everything to me times two

Why can't you just tell the truth?

If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name

If no one is around you, say, "Baby I love you"

If you ain't runnin' game

Say my name, say my name

You acting kind of shady, ain't callin' me baby

Why the sudden change?

Say my name, say my name

If no one is around you, say, "Baby I love you"

If you ain't runnin' game

Say my name, say my name

You acting kind of shady, ain't callin' me baby

Betta say my name

What is up wit this, tell the truth who you with?

How would you like it if I came over wit my clique?

Don't try to change it now, say you got to bounce

When two seconds ago you said you just got in the house

It's hard to believe that you were home by yourself

When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else

Just this question, why do you feel you got to lie?

Gettin' caught up in your game, where you cannot say my name

I know you sayin' that I'm assuming things

Something's goin' down that's the way it seems

Shouldn't be no reason, why you're acting strange?

If nobody's holding you back from me

'Cause I know how you usually do

When you sayin' everything to me times two

Why can't you just tell the truth?

If somebody's there tell me who

Say my name, say my name

If no one is around you, say, "Baby I love you"

If you ain't runnin' game

Say my name, say my name

You acting kind of shady, ain't callin' me baby

Why the sudden change?

Say my name, say my name

If no one is around you, say, "Baby I love you"

If you ain't runnin' game

Say my name, say my name

You acting kind of shady, ain't callin' me baby

Betta say my name

Where my ladies at?

Please say that, c'mon

All the girls say

I can't hear ya

All the ladies say

All the girls say

Break it down

Uh, uh, uh

D.C, take it to the bridge, c'mon

I know you sayin' I'm assuming things

Something's goin' down that's the way it seems

Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange?

If nobody's holding you back from me

'Cause I know how you usually do

When you sayin' everything to me times two

Why can't you just tell the truth?

If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name
