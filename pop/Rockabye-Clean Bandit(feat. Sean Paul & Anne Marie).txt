Call it love and devotion

Call it a mom's adoration (foundation)

A special bond of creation, hah

For all the single moms out there, going through frustration

Clean Bandit, Sean-da-Paul, Anne-Marie

Sing, make them hear

She works at nights, by the water

She's gone astray, so far away

From her father's daughter

She just wants a life for her baby

All on her own, no one will come

She's got to save him (daily struggle)

She tells him, "Ooh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love"

"I'm gonna give you all of my love"

"Nobody matters like you" (stay up there, stay up there)

She tells him, "Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life" (straight!)

"You're gonna grow and have a good life"

"I'm gonna do what I've got to do" (stay up there, stay up there)

So, rockabye, baby, rockabye

I'm gonna rock you

Rockabye, baby, don't you cry

Somebody's got you

Rockabye, baby, rockabye

I'm gonna rock you

Rockabye, baby, don't you cry

Ah, rockabye, no

Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye (oh)

Rockabye (yeah, yeah)

Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye

Single mum, how're you doing out there?

Facing the hard life, without no fear (yeah)

Just so you know that you really care

'Cause any obstacle come, you're well-prepared (oh, no)

And no, mama, you never shed tear

'Cause you have to shed things year after year (na, na, na, na)

And you give the yout love beyond compare (yeah)

You find his school fee and the bus fare (yeah)

Mmh, all when di pops disappear

Inna rum bar, can't find him nowhere

Steadily your workflow, heavily you know

So your non-stop, no time, no time for ya dear

Now she got a six-year-old

Trying to keep him warm

Trying to keep out the cold

When he looks in her eyes

He don't know he is safe

When she says, "Ooh, love no one's ever gonna hurt you, love"

"I'm gonna give you all of my love"

"Nobody matters like you"

So, rockabye, baby, rockabye

I'm gonna rock you

Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
