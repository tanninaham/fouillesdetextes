Wanna hear a part to my story? I tried to hide in the glory

And sweep it under the table, so you would never know

Sometimes I feel like an accident, people look when they're passin' it

Never check on the passenger, they just want the free show

Yeah, I'm constantly tryna fight somethin' that my eyes can't see

My mind and me, we don't get along sometimes

And it gets hard to breathe, but I wouldn't change my life

And all of the crashin' and burnin' and breakin', I know now

If somebody sees me like this, then they won't feel alone now

My mind and me

â™ª

It's hard to talk and feel heard when you always feel like a burden

Don't wanna add to concern, I know they already got

But if I pull back the curtain, then maybe someone who's hurtin'

Will be a little more certain, they're not the only one lost

Yeah, I'm constantly tryna fight somethin' that my eyes can't see

My mind and me, we don't get along sometimes

And it gets hard to breathe, but I wouldn't change my life

And all of the crashin' and burnin' and breakin', I know now

If somebody sees me like this, then they won't feel alone now

My mind and me (ah, ah, ah)

My mind and me (ah, ah, ah)

My mind, my mind

My mind and me (ah, ah, ah)

My mind and me (ah, ah, ah)

Oh, it's only my mind and me

My mind and me
