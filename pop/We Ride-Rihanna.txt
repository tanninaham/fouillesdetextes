Ride

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die ('til we die)

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one

I'm thinkin' of everything that we've become

And I hate it, I thought we could make it (make it)

But I'm ready to dead this, just wanna forget about it

I saw her pictures and the letters she sent

You had me thinking you were out with your friends

I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid

'Cause I thought it was just you and I, ooh

Now I look back on the time that we spent, and I

See it in my mind, playing over and over again

'Cause boy, right now you got me breaking down

And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you say (we ride)

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die ('til we die)

(He used to say) when we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die (we ride)

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die ('til we die)

(But I remember what you used to say)

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die

Visions in my mind of the day that we met

You showed me things that I'll never forget

Took me swimming in the ocean

You had my head up in the clouds

Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah

You think I'm playing when you know it's the truth

Nobody else can do it quite like I do

All my kisses (kisses) and my loving (and my loving)

But ain't nobody better than us, yeah-yeah

Now I look back on the time that we spent, and I

See it in my mind playing over and over again

'Cause boy right now you got me breaking down

And I just can't figure out why you said (we ride) mmh

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die ('til we die)

(He used to said)

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die (we ride)

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die

(But I remember what you used to say)

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die

I guess it's over indefinitely, but you and I know

It's not that easy to let go of everything that we planned

And start all over again, hey

Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it

I won't forget how you do it

My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now

Somehow, wanna believe you and me

We can figure it out (we ride) ooh, yeah

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die ('til we die)

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die

Gonna make you say, boy

I wish that you come hold me when I'm lonely

When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me

Just like everything you told me

(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)

Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me

And now we'll let the memories just fade away

But I remember what you used to say

When we ride, we ride it's 'til the day that we die (we ride)

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die ('til we die)

He used to say

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die (we ride)

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die ('til we die)

But I remember what you used to said

When we ride, we ride

It's 'til the day that we die (we ride)
