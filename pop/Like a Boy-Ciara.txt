C-I-A-R-A

Pull up your pants (just like 'em)

Take out the trash (just like 'em)

Gettin' your cash like 'em

Fast like 'em

Girl, you wanna act like he did (what I'm talkin' bout')

Security codes on everything

On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring

(Joint account) and another one he don't know about (hey)

Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that

Tell you I love you, but when you call, I never get back

Would you ask them questions like me, like where you be at?

'Cause I'm out, four in the morning on the corner, rolling, doing my own thing

What if I, had a thing on the side

Made you cry?

Would the rules change up, or would they still apply?

If I played you like a toy

Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Can't be getting mad, what you mad?

Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad, what you mad?

Can't handle that

Girl, go ahead and be (just like 'em)

Go run the streets (just like 'em)

Come home and sleep like 'em, creep like 'em

Front wit' your friends, act hard when you wit' 'em, like 'em (what?)

Keep a straight face when you tell a lie

Always keep an airtight alibi (keep him in the dark)

What he don't know won't break his heart (ayy)

Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that

Tell you I love you, but when you call, I never get back

Would you ask them questions like me, like where you be at?

'Cause I'm out, four in the morning on the corner, rolling, doing my own thing

What if I, had a thing on the side

Made you cry? (Made you cry?)

Would the rules change up, or would they still apply?

If I played you like a toy

Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Can't be getting mad, what you mad?

Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad, what you mad?

Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad, what you mad?

Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad, what you mad?

Can't handle that

If I was always gone

With the sun getting home (would you like that?)

Told you I was with my crew when I knew it wasn't true

If I act like you

Walk a mile off in your shoes (would you like that?)

I'm messing with your head again

Dose of your own medicine

What if I, had a thing on the side

Made you cry? (Made you cry?)

Would the rules change up, or would they still apply?

If I played you like a toy

Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Can't be getting mad, what you mad?

Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad, what you mad?

Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad, what you mad?

Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad, what you mad?

Can't handle that

R-A, go

It's The Clutch

If I played you, would you like that? (It's Ciara, ha)

Had friends, would you like that? (It's Ciara, ha, ha)

Never call, would you like that? (Another one)

No, no, you wouldn't like that, no

What you mad? Can't handle that

What if I, made you cry?

Would they still apply?

What if I, if I played you like a toy

Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy
