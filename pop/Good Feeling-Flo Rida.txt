Yes I can, doubt better leave, I'm runnin' with this plan

Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me

I'll be the president one day

January 1st, oh, you like that gossip?

Like you the one drinking what God sip, dot com

Now I gotta work with your tounge

How many rolling stones you want?

Yeah, I got a brand new spirit, speak it and it's done

Woke up on the side of the bed like I won

Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun

G5 dealer, U.S to Taiwan

Now who can say that, I wanna play back

Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack

A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach

I got a feeling it's a rap, ASAP

I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no, no

I get a good feeling (feeling, feeling, feeling)

♪

The mountain top, walk on water

I got power, feel so royal

One second, I'mma strike oil

Diamond, platinum, no more for you

Got adrenaline, never giving in

Giving up's not an option, gotta get it in

Witness I got the heart of twenty men

No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den

That flow, that spark, that crown

You looking at the king of the jungle now

Stronger than ever can't hold me down

A hundred miles feeling from the picture smile

Straight game face, it's game day

See me running through the crowd full of melee

No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates

Take a genius to understand me
