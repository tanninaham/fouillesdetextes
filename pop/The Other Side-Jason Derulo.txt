In the beginning

I never thought it would be you

When we were chillin'

Smiling in the photo booth

But we got closer (yeah)

Soon you were eating off my spoon

And coming over

And we would talk all afternoon

Tonight, we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace

Find your hands all over me

And then you bite your lip, whisper and say

"We're going all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side

Sparks fly like the Fourth of July

Just take me to the other side

I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know

We ain't friends anymore

If we walk down this road

We'll be lovers for sure

So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die

And take me to the other side

Ayy, this could be perfect (yeah)

But we won't know unless we try (try)

I know you're nervous

So just sit back and let me drive

Tonight, we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace

Find your hands all over me

And then you bite your lip, whisper and say

"We're going all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side

Sparks fly like the Fourth of July

Just take me to the other side

I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know

We ain't friends anymore

If we walk down this road

We'll be lovers for sure

So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die

And take me to the other side

â™ª

Kiss me like it's do or die (oh)

And take me to the other side

Tonight, we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace

Let your love crash into me

And then you bite your lip, whisper and say

"We're going all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side

Sparks fly like the Fourth of July (blasting through the air)

Just take me to the other side (take me, baby)

I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know

We ain't friends anymore (oh, no, girl)

If we walk down this road

We'll be lovers for sure

So tonight (so tonight), kiss me like it's do or die (kiss, kiss)

And take me to the other side (oh)

Take me to the other side (oh)

And take me to the other side (oh)

Kiss me like it's do or die (oh)

And take me to the other side
