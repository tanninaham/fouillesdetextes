I took an arrow to the heart

I never kissed a mouth that taste like yours

Strawberries and something more

Ooh, yeah, I want it all

Lipstick on my guitar (ooh)

Fill up the engine, we can drive real far

Go dancing underneath the stars

Ooh, yeah, I want it all

Hmm, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy

I wanna kiss your eyes

I wanna drink that smile

I wanna feel like I'm

Like my soul's on fire

I wanna stay up all day and all night

Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

And when they say the party's over, then we bring it right back

And we'll say

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks?

And when they say the party's over, then we bring it right back

Into the car

On the back seat in the moonlit dark

Wrap me up between your legs and arms

Ooh, I can't get enough

You know you could tear me apart (ooh)

Put me back together, and take my heart

I never thought that I could love this hard

Ooh, I can't get enough

Hmm, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy

I wanna kiss your eyes

I wanna drink that smile

I wanna feel like I'm

Like my soul's on fire

I wanna stay up all day and all night

Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks?

And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

And we'll say

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver

With the fire you got, this thing we started

I don't want it to stop, you know you make me shiver, ah, ah-ah

Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver

With the fire you got, this thing we started

I don't want it to stop, you know you make me shiver

Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

And we'll say

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that

And when you're close up, give me the shivers

Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til sunlight cracks

And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Hey
