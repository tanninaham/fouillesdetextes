Tastes like strawberries

On a summer evenin'

And it sounds just like a song

I want more berries

And that summer feelin'

It's so wonderful and warm

Breathe me in

Breathe me out

I don't know if I could ever go without

I'm just thinking out loud

I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar

Watermelon sugar

High

Watermelon sugar

High

Watermelon sugar high

Watermelon sugar

Strawberries

On a summer evenin'

Baby, you're the end of June

I want your belly

And that summer feelin'

Getting washed away in you

Breathe me in

Breathe me out

I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar

Watermelon sugar high

I just wanna taste it

I just wanna taste it

Watermelon sugar high

Tastes like strawberries

On a summer evenin'

And it sounds just like a song

I want your belly

And that summer feelin'

I don't know if I could ever go without
