When I was six years old, I broke my leg

When I was running from my brother and his friends

And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down

Well, I was younger then, take me back to when

I found my heart and broke it here

Made friends and lost them through the years

And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown

But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way

Driving at 90 down those country lanes

Singing to "Tiny Dancer"

And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real

And we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

15 years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes

Running from the law through the backfields

And getting drunk with my friends

Had my first kiss on a Friday night

I don't reckon that I did it right

But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid

We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight

Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown

But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way (hoo-hoo)

Driving at 90 down those country lanes (hoo-hoo)

Singing to "Tiny Dancer"

And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real

And we watched the sunset (hoo-hoo), over the castle on the hill

Hoo-hoo, over the castle on the hill

Hoo-hoo, over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes, one works down by the coast

One had two kids but lives alone, one's brother overdosed

One's already on his second wife, one's just barely getting by

But these people raised me and I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way

I still remember these old country lanes

When we did not know the answers

And I miss the way (hoo-hoo) you make me feel, it's real

When we watched the sunset (hoo-hoo) over the castle on the hill

Hoo-hoo, over the castle on the hill

Hoo-hoo, over the castle on the hill
