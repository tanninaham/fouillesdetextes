Hello, you know you look even better

Than the way you did now before (before)

And the moment that you kissed my lips

You know I started to feel wonderful (wonderful)

It's something incredible

There's sex in your chemicals, oh (sex in your chemicals)

Ooh, let's go, you're the best way I know

To escape the extraordinary (ordinary)

This world ain't for you and I know for damn sure

This world ain't for me (world ain't for me)

Lift off and say goodbye

Just let your fire set me free

Oh, moonshine (ooh)

Take us to the stars tonight (ooh)

Take us to that special place (ooh)

That place we went the last time, the last time

I know (I know), I was with you last night

But it feels like it's been so long (so long)

And everybody that's around they know

That I'm not myself when you're gone (myself when you're gone)

It's good to see you again, good to see you again

On top of the world (the world)

Is where I stand when you're back in my life (back in my life)

Life's not so bad when you're way up this high

Everything is alright (everything is alright)

Everything is alright

Oh, moonshine (ooh)

Take us to the stars tonight (ooh)

Take us to that special place (ooh)

That place we went the last time, the last time

Oh, moonshine (ooh)

Your love it makes me come alive (ooh)

Take us to that special place (ooh)

That place we went the last time, the last time

Don't look down, don't you never look back

We are not afraid to die young and live fast

Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs

Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

Moonshine (ooh)

Take us to the stars tonight (ooh)

Take us to that special place (ooh)

That place we went the last time, the last time

Oh, moonshine (ooh)

Your love it makes me come alive (ooh)

Take us to that special place (ooh)

That place we went the last time, the last time
