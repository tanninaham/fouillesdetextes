Young, standing on the edge of 21

Staring at the man that I've become

Sometimes when I lose my control

He's dumb, if you blink he'll blow up like a gun

Jumping to conclusions just for fun

That guy, needs somebody to hold

Needs somebody he knows

Where the hell did she go?

It kinda makes me feel like

I wish I could change my name

I wish I could start again

Fly me to a lonely place where you'll never see my face

So you'll never feel the pain of

What was

When you're standing in the rain, calling out my name

Nothing's gonna change

What was

â™ª

Cold, driving through my neighborhood alone

Goin' past the house, but I'm not home this time

I haven't been in a while

I haven't been 'cause I'm far away

In another state, miles away from us

As you try fan a dyin' the flame

While ashes turn to dust

I wish I could change my name

I wish I could start again

Fly me to a lonely place where you'll never see my face

So you'll never feel the pain of

What was

When you're standing in the rain calling out my name

Nothing's gonna change

What was

Let me, start over

The moment that I left you in tears

Is a memory that will haunt me for years

And years, and years, and years, and years

(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh) oh, it still does

(Oh-oh-oh) oh, it still does

What was

You need somebody to hold

Where the hell did I go?
