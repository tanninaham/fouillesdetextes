When Mama said that it was okay

Mama said that it was quite alright

Our kind of people had a bed for the night

And it was okay

Mama told us we were good kids

And Daddy told us, "Never listen to the ones

Pointing nasty fingers and making fun"

'Cause we were good kids

Remember asking both my mom and dad

Why we never traveled to exotic lands

We only ever really visit friends

Nothing to tell when the summer ends

We never really went buying clothes

Folks were passing on the stuff in plenty loads

New shoes once a year and then

Out to play ball so we could ruin them

When Mama said that it was okay

Mama said that it was quite alright

Our kind of people had a bed for the night

And it was okay

Mama told us we were good kids

And Daddy told us, "Never listen to the ones

Pointing nasty fingers and making fun"

'Cause we were good kids

Don't get me wrong I didn't have it bad

I got enough loving from my mom and dad

But I don't think they really understood

When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood

I told them I'll be singing on TV

The other kids were calling me a wannabe

The older kids, they started bugging me

But now they're all standing right in front of me

When Mama said that it was okay

Mama said that it was quite alright

Our kind of people had a bed for the night

And it was okay

Mama told us we were good kids

And Daddy told us, "Never listen to the ones

Pointing nasty fingers and making fun"

'Cause we were good kids

I know which place I'm from

I know my home

When I'm in doubt and struggling

That's where I go

An old friend can give advice

When new friends only know a half story

That's why I always keep 'em tight

And why I'm okay

I said I'm okay

You know what my mama said?

You know what she told me?

My Mama said that it was okay

Mama said that it was quite alright

Our kind of people had a bed for the night

And it was okay

Mama told us we were good kids

And Daddy told us, "Never listen to the ones

Pointing nasty fingers and making fun"

'Cause we were good kids

And Mama said that it was okay

Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba

Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba

Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba

And Mama said that it was okay

Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba

Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba

Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba

And Mama said that it was okay
