Kisses on your body were like heaven, we were taking it slow

♪

Tangled in the sheets until the evening, there was nowhere to go, yeah

♪

We were in a daze learning each other's shapes

Tracing shadows of rain down your back, oh-oh

Kisses on your body in my memory, baby, nothing comes close

♪

It was the summer of love

A delicate daydream

And for a couple of months

It felt like we were 18, yeah

It was the summer of love

La-la-love

La-la-love, yeah

It was the summer of

La-la-love

La-la-love

Meditation and tequila

Calling you my señorita

Didn't know how much I need ya

Hate it when I have to leave ya

I've been taking mental pictures

For when I miss you in the winter

Stayin' up until the sunrise

Praying it won't be the last time

It was the summer of love

A delicate daydream

And for a couple of months

It felt like we were 18, yeah

It was the summer of love

La-la-love, yeah

It was the summer of
