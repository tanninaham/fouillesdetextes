Oh girl I like you, I do

I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in the Benz

I like you, I do

I'll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans?

I like you, I do

We went over to France, then we woke up in Japan

I like you, I do (I do)

Oh girl, I know you only like it fancy

So I pull up in that Maybach Candy

Yeah, your boyfriend'll never understand me

'Cause I'm 'bout to pull his girl like a hammy, hammy

Let's take a lil' dip, lil' lady

Hit PCH, 180

Yeah, I've been thinkin' lately

That I need someone to save me

Now that I'm famous, I got hoes all around me, but

I need a good girl, I need someone to ground me, so

Please be true, don't fuck around with me

I need someone to share this heart with me

Fill you up, then run it back again

Oh girl I like you, I do

I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in the Benz

I like you, I do

I'll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans?

I like you, I do

We went to bed in France, then we woke up in Japan

I like you, I do, I do

Let me know when you're free

'Cause I been tryna hit it all week, babe

Why you acting all sweet?

I know that you want little ol' me

I get a little OD

But ain't shit new to a freak

Let me drop bands, put a jewel in ya teeth

He love the way I drip, turn that pool to the beach

And I coulda copped a Birkin but I cop Celine

Why we got the same taste for the finer things?

Brand-new nigga with the same old team

Now he got me on a leash 'cause he said no strings

You know I'm cool with that

Stole the pussy, you ain't get sued for that

Wonder what a nigga might do for that (do, might do)

I could be your Chaka, where Rufus at? (Where?)

80 in the Benz when that roof go back

They don't wanna see us get too attached

I just got a feeling that we might be friends for a long, long time

You don't mind, and you know I like you for that

Oh girl, I like you, I do

I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in the Benz

I like you, I do

I'll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans?

I like you, I do

We went to bed in France, then we woke up in Japan

I like you, I do, I do

I just want you, I just want you

Your heart's so big, but that ass is huge

Just want you, oh baby do

You like me too, ooh, ooh

Girl, I like you, I do

I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in the Benz

I like you, I do, I do
