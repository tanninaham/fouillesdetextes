Woo!

Storch (oh)

S. Dot (yeah)

Ooh (the dynamic duo!)

Wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, wo-womp

It's what your body sayin'

Wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, wo-womp

Chris Brown is in the building

The young boy just turned 16, and I got (whoo)

64's and hot bikes that I rock

Keep three or four sweeties on my clock

But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em dizzy

Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop

'Cause you speak in that slang that I talk

That sassy tempo with that walk

Maybe the reason that all this teenies may never see me

Momma, you may be three years older, but you hot (gimme that)

You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)

I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac

You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

Momma, you may be three years older, but you hot (gimme that)

You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)

I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac

You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

Ma, take a break, let me explain to you

What ya body got a young boy ready to do

If you take a chance to let me put them things on you

I could show you why I make them straight A's in school

I'm a hustler

Trust my frame and age

Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page

I can picture us switching lanes

In the coupe with you on the phone screaming my name (Chris!)

Momma, you may be three years older, but you hot (gimme that)

You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)

I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac

You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

Momma, you may be three years older, but you hot (gimme that)

You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)

I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac

You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

Wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, wo-womp

Girl you serious and I been watching you

Wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, wo-womp

This what your body's saying

Wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, wo-womp

Wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, womp, wo-womp, wo-womp (hey)

This what your body's sayin (oh!)

Momma, you may be three years older, but you hot (gimme that)

You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)

I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac

You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

Momma, you may be three years older, but you hot (gimme that)
