Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air

â™ª

If I should die before I wake

It's 'cause you took my breath away

Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh

I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave

My heart won't move, it's incomplete

Wish there was a way that I can make you understand

But how do you expect me

To live alone with just me?

'Cause my world revolves around you

It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air

Can't live, can't breathe with no air

It's how I feel whenever you ain't there

It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep

Tell me how you gonna be without me

If you ain't here, I just can't breathe

It's no air, no air

No air, air (oh)

No air, air (no)

No air, air (oh)

No air, air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew

Right off the ground to float to you

There's no gravity to hold me down for real

But somehow, I'm still alive inside

You took my breath, but I survived

I don't know how, but I don't even care

So how do you expect me

To live alone with just me?

'Cause my world revolves around you

It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (oh, oh)

Can't live, can't breathe with no air (oh, oh)

It's how I feel whenever you ain't there

It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep (so deep)

Tell me how you gonna be without me (yeah)

If you ain't here, I just can't breathe

It's no air, no air (no air)

No air, air (oh)

No air, air (oh)

No air, air (no)

No air, air (no more)

No, no, no, no air

No, no, no air (no, ooh, baby)

No, no, no air (oh)

It's no air, no air

Air (no)

No air (no)

No, no, no air

Oh

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (no air)

Can't live, can't breathe with no air (oh, no air)

It's how I feel whenever you ain't there (no breathing)

It's no air, no air (no breathing)

Got me out here in the water so deep (so deep)

Tell me how you gonna be without me (yeah)

If you ain't here, I just can't breathe

It's no air, no air (no air)

No air, air (so how do you expect me)

No air, air (to live alone with just me?)

No air, air ('cause my world revolves around you)

No air, air (it's so hard for me to breathe)

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (no air)

Can't live, can't breathe with no air (no, no, no)

It's how I feel whenever you ain't there (oh, nothing)

It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep

Tell me how you gonna be without me

If you ain't here, I just can't breathe

It's no air, no air

No air, air (oh)

No air, air (oh)

No air, air (no air)

No air
