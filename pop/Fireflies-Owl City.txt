You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies

Lit up the world as I fell asleep

'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere

You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe

That Planet Earth turns slowly

It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs

As they tried to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed

A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe

That Planet Earth turns slowly

It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack (please, take me away from here)

'Cause I feel like such an insomniac (please, take me away from here)

Why do I tire of counting sheep (please, take me away from here)

When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

To ten million fireflies

I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes

I got misty eyes as they said farewell (they said farewell)

But I'll know where several are

If my dreams get real bizarre

'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar

I'd like to make myself believe

That Planet Earth turns slowly

It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe

That Planet Earth turns slowly

It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe

That Planet Earth turns slowly

It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

Because my dreams are bursting at the seams
