Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la

Mmm

Uh huh

I was down at the New Amsterdam

Staring at this yellow-haired girl

Mr Jones strikes up a conversation

With a black-haired flamenco dancer

You know, she dances while his father plays guitar

She's suddenly beautiful

We all want something beautiful

Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance the silence down through the morning

Sha la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Yeah

Uh huh

Yeah

Cut up, Maria!

Show me some of that Spanish dancin'

Pass me a bottle, Mr Jones

Believe in me

Help me believe in anything

'Cause I want to be someone who believes

Yeah

Mr Jones and me

Tell each other fairy tales

And we stare at the beautiful women

She's looking at you

Ah, no, no, she's looking at me

Smilin' in the bright lights

Coming through in stereo

When everybody loves you

You can never be lonely

Well, I'm gonna paint my picture

Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray

All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful

Yeah, well, you know grey is my favorite color

I felt so symbolic yesterday

If I knew Picasso

I would buy myself a grey guitar and play

Mr Jones and me

Look into the future

Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women

She's looking at you

I don't think so

She's looking at me

Standing in the spotlight

I bought myself a grey guitar

When everybody loves me

I will never be lonely

I will never be lonely

Said I'm never gonna be

Lonely

I wanna be a lion

Yeah, everybody wants to pass as cats

We all wanna be big, big stars

Yeah, but we got different reasons for that

Believe in me

'Cause I don't believe in anything

And I wanna be someone to believe

To believe, to believe

Yeah!

Mr Jones and me

Stumbling through the Barrio

Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women

She's perfect for you

Man, there's got to be somebody for me

I wanna be Bob Dylan

Mr Jones wishes he was someone

Just a little more funky

When everybody love you

Oh! Son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Mr Jones and me

Starin' at the video

When I look at the television, I wanna see me

Staring right back at me

We all wanna be big stars

But we don't know why, and we don't know how

But when everybody loves me

I wanna be just about as happy as I can be

Mr Jones and me

We're gonna be big stars
