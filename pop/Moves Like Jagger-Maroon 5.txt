Oh, na, oh

Just shoot for the stars, if it feels right

Then aim for my heart, if you feel like

And take me away

And make it okay

I swear, I'll behave

You wanted control, so we waited

I put on a show, now we're naked

You say, I'm a kid

My ego is big

I don't give a shit

And it goes like this

(Ah) take me by the tongue, and I'll know you

(Ah) kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you

All the moves like Jagger

I've got the moves like Jagger

I've got the moo-oo-oo-ooves like Jagger

(Ah) I don't need try to control you

(Ah) look into my eyes, and I'll own you

With them the moves like Jagger

I've got the moves like Jagger

I've got the moo-oo-oo-ooves like Jagger

Baby, it's hard when you feel like

You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right

But when you're with me

I'll make you believe

That I've got the key

Oh, so get in the car, you can ride it

Wherever you want, get inside it

And you want to steer

But I'm shifting gears

I'll take it from here

Oh, yeah, yeah, and it goes like this

(Ah) take me by the tongue, and I'll know you

(Ah) kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you

All the moves like Jagger

I've got the moves like Jagger

I've got the moo-oo-oo-ooves like Jagger (woo)

(Ah) I don't need try to control you (oh, yeah)

(Ah) look into my eyes, and I'll own you

With them the moves like Jagger

I've got the moves like Jagger (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I've got the moo-oo-oo-ooves like Jagger

(Uh) you wanna know how to make me smile

Take control, own me just for the night

And if I share my secret

You're gonna have to keep it

Nobody else can see this

(Uh) so watch and learn, I won't show you twice

Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right yeah

And if I share my secret

You're gonna have to keep it

Nobody else can see this (ay-yeah-yeah-yeah)

And it goes like this

(Ah) take me by the tongue, and I'll know you (take me by the tongue)

(Ah) kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you (yeah, yeah)

All the moves like Jagger

I've got the moves like Jagger

I've got the moo-oo-oo-ooves like Jagger (ooh, yeah)

(Ah) I don't need try to control you (ooh)

(Ah) look into my eyes, and I'll own you (ah)

With them the moves like Jagger

I've got the moves like Jagger

I've got the moo-oo-oo-ooves like Jagger
