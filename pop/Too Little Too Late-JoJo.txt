Mm no, mm

Mm-mm

Come with me, stay the night

You say the words, but boy, it don't feel right

What do ya expect me to say?

(You know it's just too little too late)

You take my hand, and you say you've changed

But boy, you know your begging don't fool me

Because to you, it's just a game

(You know it's just too little too late)

So let me on down

'Cause time has made me strong

I'm starting to move on

I'm gonna say this now

Your chance has come and gone

And you know

It's just too little too late

A little too wrong, and I can't wait

But you know all the right things to say

You know it's just too little too late

You say you dream of my face

But you don't like me, you just like the chase

To be real, it doesn't matter anyway

You know it's just too little too late

Yeah, yeah

It's just too little too late

Mm-mm

I was young and in love

I gave you everything, but it wasn't enough

And now you wanna communicate

(You know it's just too little too late)

Go find someone else

In letting you go, I'm loving myself

You got a problem

But don't come asking me for help

'Cause you know

It's just too little too late

A little too wrong, and I can't wait

But you know all the right things to say

You know it's just too little too late

You say you dream of my face

But you don't like me, you just like the chase

To be real, it doesn't matter anyway

You know it's just too little too late

I can love with all of my heart, baby

I know I have so much to give (I've got so much to give)

With a player like you, I don't have a prayer

That's no way to live, oh, oh-ooh

Mm, no, whoa, whoa

It's just too little too late

Yeah, yeah!

It's just too little too late (too late, babe)

A little too wrong, and I can't wait (yeah, yeah, yeah)

But you know all the right things to say (woo!)

You know it's just too little too late

You say you dream of my face

But you don't like me, you just like the chase (you just like the chase baby)

To be real, it doesn't matter anyway (hey, hey)

You know it's just too little too late (ah, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know it's just too little too late (ooh)

I can't wait, no, no, no

It's just too little too late

A little too wrong, and I can't wait

But you know all the right things to say (yeah, yeah, yeah)

You know it's just too little too late

You say you dream of my face

But you don't like me, you just like the chase

To be real, it doesn't matter anyway

You know it's just too little too late
