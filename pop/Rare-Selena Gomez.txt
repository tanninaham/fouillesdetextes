You all in your feelings, baby, all into me
I'm one in a billion, baby, don't you agree?
Obviously, you know, I'm aware of it
I'm breakin' hearts like a heart attack
Got him right where the carat's at
Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They just like puppets on a string, string, string
I put it down, they call me up
They doin' way too much
So I'll just let it ring, ring, ring (Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, I received your message, all 23 (23)
You know I'm Jordan with it, G-O-A-T (G-O-A-T)
Obviously, you know, I'm aware of it
I'm breakin' hearts like a heart attack
I got him right where the carat's at (Yeah)
Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They just like puppets on a string, string, string
I put it down, they call me up
They doin' way too much
So I'll just let it ring, ring, ring
Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
He wanna give me everything, thing, thing?
I put it down, they call me up
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
So I'll just let it ring, ring, ring
Circlin' me, they just like satellites (Ooh)
Circlin' me all day and every night (Ooh, yeah)
Circlin' me, I'm sure you sympathize (Ooh)
A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ooh)

Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They just like puppets on a string, string, string
I put it down, they call me up
They doin' way too much
So I'll just let it ring, ring, ring
Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They wanna give me everything, thing, thing
I put it down, they call me up
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
So I'll just let it ring, ring, ring
