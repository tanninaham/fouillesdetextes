I got a feeling

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling (woo-hoo)

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling (woo-hoo)

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (a feel-)

Tonight's the night, let's live it up

I got my money, let's spend it up

Go out and smash it, like, oh my god

Jump off that sofa, let's kick it off

I know that we'll have a ball

If we get down and go out and just lose it all

I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go

Let's go way out, spaced out and losing all control

Fill up my cup, mazel tov

Look at her dancing, just take it off

Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down

Let's burn the roof, and then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

And do it, and do it, let's live it up

And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

'Cause I got a feeling (woo-hoo)

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling (woo-hoo)

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (a feel-)

Tonight's the night (hey), let's live it up (let's live it up)

I got my money (I'm paid), let's spend it up (let's spend it up)

Go out and smash it (smash it), like, oh my god (like, oh my god)

Jump off that sofa (come on), let's kick it off

Fill up my cup (drink), mazel tov (l'chaim)

Look at her dancing (move it, move it), just take it off

Let's paint the town (paint the town), we'll shut it down (shut it down)

Let's burn the roof (ooh), and then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it (let's do it)

And do it (do it), and do it, let's live it up

And do it (do it), and do it (and do it)

And do it (and), do it (and), do it (and do it)

Let's do it (and do it), let's do it (and do it)

Let's do it (hey), do it (hey), do it (hey), do it

Here we come, here we go, we gotta rock

Easy come, easy go, now we on top

Fill the shot, body rock, rock it, don't stop

'Round and 'round, up and down, around the clock

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (do it)

Friday, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday (do it)

Get, get, get, get, get with us, you know what we say, say

Party every day, pa-pa-pa-party every day

And I'm feeling (woo-hoo)

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling (woo-hoo)

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

Woo-hoo
