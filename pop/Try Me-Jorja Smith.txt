Ask me about me again

You know it hurts to feel it

You should read between these-

Ask me about me again

Even when my heart declines

Nothing works when I don't

Go 'head try me

'Cause I'm safe behind these walls

Think you can take me through the fog where I'm no challenge

Childish (childish), childish

Yeah, you, you can try me

I've changed?

There's only been one thing that I've changed

Nothin' is ever enough

I don't have to tell you what I've changed, oh-oh, no

'Cause I couldn't tell you that I've changed (changed)

There's only been one thng that has changed (changed, changed)

Nothin' is ever enough (changed)

I don't have to tell you what I've changed, no-oh, no

'Cause I couldn't tell you that-

I, I think too fast at times

I try to keep it out

But it don't work even though I try to forget that

Even though I try to forget that

I know that it's hard to ignore it

I know that it's heartless to play me

Go 'head try me

I've changed?

There's only been one thing that I've changed

Nothin' is ever enough

I don't have to tell you what I've changed, oh-oh, no

'Cause I couldn't tell you that I've changed (changed)

There's only been one thing that has changed

Nothin' is ever enough (changed)

I don't have to tell you what I've changed, no-oh

'Cause I couldn't tell you that

Hoping I've learnt

Take back your word

Might hurt, but I won't hide

I know myself, I know I wasn't

The only one that has been through what I have today

Can you wait for this second?

To please somebody else other than your needs, hm

You've got a lot left on these sleeves

But your heart's not on your sleeve

Try to believe me though

Gotta listen, gotta learn, gotta live, gotta fight, gotta earn

And your mind's made up on me

I say your mind's made up on me

Gotta live, gotta learn
