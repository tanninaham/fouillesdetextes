I keep my exes locked in a penthouse

Oh, what can I do? (Oh, what can I do, babe?)

I keep my fingers crossed when I see ya

Whatever you do

I wanna travel the world and bring you along

I wanna see the other side of the moon

I never believed in a thing called love

Until I saw your face walk in the room

'Cause when it comes to love, I've been cynical

Even psychoanalytical

Thinking love ain't nothing but a chemical or two

But then I met you

I keep my exes locked in a penthouse

Oh, what can I do? (Oh, what can I do, babe?)

I keep my fingers crossed when I see you

Whatever you do

She's a crazy one, but a lot of fun

She's keeping pictures of herself around like she's the one

She's quoting Nietzsche and drinks tequila

Having the time of her life

But when it comes to love, I've been cynical

Even psychoanalytical

Thinking love ain't nothing but a chemical or two

But then I met you

I keep my exes locked in a penthouse

Oh, what can I do? (Oh, what can I do, babe?)

I keep my fingers crossed when I see ya

Whatever you do

Ta, ta-da-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da

(Oh, what can I do, babe?)

Ta, ta-da-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da

Oh, oh, oh, oh

18 summers, 18 lovers

But no one like you

Now, I see you standing there

I got nothing left to lose (oh, oh, oh)

I keep my exes locked in a penthouse

Oh, what can I do? (Oh, what can I do, babe?)

I keep my fingers crossed when I see ya

Whatever you do

Ta, ta-da-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da

(Oh, what can I do, babe?)

Ta, ta-da-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da

Ta, ta-da-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da

(Oh, what can I do, babe?)
